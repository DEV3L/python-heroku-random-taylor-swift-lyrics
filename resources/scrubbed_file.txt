Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall.
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall.
No matter what you say, I still can't believe that you would walk away.
It don't make sense to me, but why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
It's not unbroken anymore.
How do I get it back the way it was before?
Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a.
I don't know what I want, so don't ask me.
Cause I'm still trying to figure it out don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking.
Trying to see through the rain coming down even though I'm not the only one who feels the way I do.
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on.
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world got the radio on, my old blue jeans.
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve.
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine could you tell me what more do I need.
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah but that's ok.
Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission but I'm ready to fly.
Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know oh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world.
Oh I'm just a girl oh I'm just a girl, oh, oh you have a way of coming easily to me.
And when you take, you take the very best of me.
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something and you do what you want cause I'm not what you wanted.
Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say and now that I'm sitting here thinking it through.
I've never been anywhere cold as you you put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray and I stood there loving you and wished them all away.
And you come away with a great little story of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you you never did give a damn thing honey but I cried, cried for you.
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you (Died for you).
Every smile you fake is so condescending counting all the scars you made.
Friday night beneath the stars in a field behind your yard.
you and I are paintin' pictures in the sky.
And sometimes we don't say a thing;.
just listen to the crickets sing.
Everything I need is right here by my side.
And I know everything about you.
I don't wanna live without you.
I'm only up when you're not down.
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.
It's like no matter what I do.
Well you drive me crazy half the time; the other half I'm only trying to let you know that what I feel is true.
And I'm only me when I'm with you.
Just a small town boy and girl livin' in a crazy world.
Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true.
And I don't try to hide my tears.
The secrets or my deepest fears.
Through it all nobody gets me like you do.
And you know everything about me.
You say that you can't live without me.
When I'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself.
Only you can tell.
That I'm only up when you're not down.
And I'm only me.
Who I wanna be well, I'm only me when I'm with you.
With you uh huh she cant see the way your eyes.
Light up when you smile.
Shell never notice how you stop and stare whenever she walks by.
And you cant see me wantin' you the way you want her but you are everything to me.
I just wanna show you she dont even know you.
She's never gonna love you like I want to.
And you just see right through me.
If you only knew me we could be a beautiful Instead of just invisible.
Theres a fire inside of you that cant help but shine through.
Shes never gonna see the light no matter what you do.
And all I think about is how to make you think of me and everything that we could be like shadows in a faded light.
Oh, were invisible.
I just wanna open your eyes and make you realize.
She dont even know you.
Baby, let me love you let me want you.
You just see right through me.
But if you only knew me.
She said, I was seven and you were nine.
I looked at you like the stars that shined.
In the sky, the pretty lights and our daddies used to joke about the two of us.
Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes and said oh my my my take me back to the house in the backyard tree.
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me.
You never did, you never did take me back when our world was one block wide.
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried.
Just two kids, you and I...
Oh my my my my well, I was sixteen when suddenly.
I wasn't that little girl you used to see but your eyes still shined like pretty lights.
They never believed we'd really fall in love.
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes.
And said oh my my my...
Take me back to the creek beds we turned up two A.M. riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me.
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight the slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight.
You stayed outside till the morning light a few years had gone and come around.
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town.
And you looked at me, got down on one knee take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle.
Our whole town came and our mamas cried you said I do and I did too take me home where we met so many years before.
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch after all this time, you and I I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine.
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine In the sky, oh my my my...
I was riding shotgun.
With my hair undone In the front seat of his car.
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel.
The other on my heart I look around, turn the radio down he says, "Baby is something wrong?".
I say, "Nothing.
I was just thinking how we don't have a song." and he says...
Our song is the slamming screen door.
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window.
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow 'Cause it's late and your mama don't know.
Our song is the way you laugh the first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have." and when I got home ... 'fore I said, "Amen.".
Asking God if he could play it again.
I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day.
Had gone all wrong.
And been trampled on and lost and thrown away.
Got to the hallway well, on my way.
To my lovin' bed I almost didn't notice all the roses.
And the note that said,..
I've heard every album, listened to the radio.
Waited for something to come along.
That was as good as our song...
'Cause our song is the slamming screen door sneakin' out late, tapping on his window.
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow.
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know our song is the way he laughs.
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss him, when I should have.".
Play it again oh, yeah...
Oh-oh, yeah.
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin.
And I wrote down our song.
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy.
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me so go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy.
That's fine I'll tell mine that you're gay!
That's fine you won't mind if I say by the way...
I hate that stupid old pickup truck.
You never let me drive you're a redneck heartbreak.
Who's really bad at lying so watch me strike a match.
On all my wasted time as far as I'm concerned you're.
Just another picture to burn!
There's no time for tears I'm just sitting here planning my revenge.
There's nothing stopping me from going out with all of your best friends and if you come around saying sorry to me.
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be and if you're missing me you'd better keep it to yourself.
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health...
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck.
In case you haven't heard.
I really really hate that...
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn you're just another picture to burn.
Baby, burn...
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing.
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone.
Yesterday I found out about you even now just looking at you feels wrong you say that you'd take it all back, given one chance.
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes." you should've said "No", you should've gone home.
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go you should've known that word, with what you did with her get back to me (get back to me).
And I should've been there in the back of your mind I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?" you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
You should've said "No", baby, and you might still have me.
You can see that I've been crying.
Baby, you know all the right things to say but do you honestly expect me to believe.
We could ever be the same?
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance I can't resist before you go, tell me this.
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
No... no, no, no...
Cory's eyes are like a jungle he smiles, it's like the radio.
He whispers songs into my window.
In words that nobody knows.
There's pretty girls on every corner.
That watch him as he's walking home saying, "Does he know?" will you ever know?
You're beautiful every little piece love and don't you know.
You're really gonna be someone.
Ask anyone.
And when you find everything you looked for I hope your life lead you back to my door.
Oh, but if it don't stay beautiful.
Cory finds another way to be the highlight of my day.
I'm taking pictures in my mind so I can save them for a rainy day It's hard to make a conversation.
When he's taking my breath away.
I should say, hey, by the way...
If you and I are a story.
That never gets told If what you are is a daydream I'll never get to hold.
At least you'll know...
I hope your life lead you back to my front door.
Will you stay beautiful, beautiful, beautiful la la la.
Oh, oh, oh, oh na, na, na, na, na.
Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see that I want and I'm needing everything that we should be I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about.
And she's got everything that I have to live without.
Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it's just so funny drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny that I can't even see anyone when he's with me.
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar.
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star.
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do.
Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly the kind of flawless I wish I could be.
She better hold him tight, give him all her love look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause so I drive home alone.
As I turn out the light.
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight.
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar.
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart.
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough.
And he's all that I need to fall into.
Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see.
I didn't know what I would find.
When I went looking for a reason, I know I didn't read between the lines.
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go I tried to take the road less traveled by but nothing seems to work the first few times.
Am I right?
So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in I can still see you, this ain't the best view on the outside looking in.
I've been a lot of lonely places I've never been on the outside.
You saw me there, but never knew I would give it all up to be.
A part of this, a part of you and now it's all too late so you see you could've helped if you had wanted to.
But no one notices until it's too late to do anything seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty.
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you.
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty but that's not true, cause I know you...
Hold on, baby, you're losing it.
The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go... and no one knows.
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone that you might not be the golden one and you're tied together with a smile.
But you're coming undone I guess it's true that love was all you wanted cause you're giving it away like it's extra change.
Hoping it will end up in his pocket but he leaves you out like a penny in the rain oh, cause it's not his price to pay.
Not his price to pay...
You're tied together with a smile.
But you're coming undone... oh goodbye, baby.
With a smile, baby, baby he said the way my blue eyes shined.
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night I said, "That's a lie.".
Just a boy in a Chevy truck.
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck.
On back roads at night and I was right there beside him all summer long.
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone.
But when you think Tim McGraw I hope you think my favorite song.
The one we danced to all night long the moon like a spotlight on the lake when you think happiness.
I hope you think that little black dress think of my head on your chest.
And my old faded blue jeans when you think Tim McGraw I hope you think of me.
September saw a month of tears and thankin' God that you weren't here.
To see me like that but in a box beneath my bed.
Is a letter that you never read from three summers back.
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet.
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe and I'm back for the first time since then.
I'm standin' on your street and there's a letter left on your doorstep.
And the first thing that you'll read is.
Someday you'll turn your radio on I hope it takes you back to that place.
Oh, think of me please take down the misletoe.
Cause I don't wanna think about that right now cause everything I want is miles away.
In a snow covered little town my momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me.
Season's greetings, hope you're well well I'm doing alright.
If you were wondering.
Lately I can never tell I know this shouldn't be a lonely time but there were Christmases when you were mine.
I've been doing fine without you, really.
Up until the nights got cold.
And everybody's here, except you, baby seems like everyone's got someone to hold but for me it's just a lonely time.
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine.
Merry Christmas everybody that'll have to be something I just say this year.
I'll bet you got your mom another sweater.
And were your cousins late again.
When you were putting up the lights this year did you notice one less pair of hands.
But there were Christmases when I didn't wonder how you are tonight you were mine.
What if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing?
Would the song still survive without five golden rings?
Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe?
What would happen if God never let it snow?
What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie?
Tell me what would you find you'd see that today holds something special something holy, not superficial.
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives It's something we all try to ignore.
And put a wreath up on your door.
So here's something you should know that is for sure christmas must be something more what if angels did not pay attention to.
All the things that we wished they would always do?
What if happiness came in a cardboard box?
Then I think there is something we all forgot what would happen if presents all went away?
We get so caught up in all of it.
Business and relationships hundred mile an hour lives.
And it's this time of year and everybody's here It seems the last thing on your mind.
Is that the day holds something special.
Something holy, not superficial?
So here's to Jesus Christ who saved our lives but here's something you should know that is for sure christmas must be something.
There's gotta be more last Christmas I gave you my heart but the very next day, you gave it away.
This year, to save me from tears.
I'll give it to someone special.
Once bitten and twice shied I keep my distance but you still catch my eye.
Tell me baby.
Do you recognize me.
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it with a note saying 'I love you', I meant it.
Now I know what a fool I've been.
But if you kiss me now, I know you'd fool me again a crowded room and friends with tired eyes.
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice my God, I thought you were someone to rely on me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on.
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart a girl on a cover but you tore her apart maybe this year.
Maybe this year I'll give it to someone special.
Cause last Christmas I gave you my heart.
And last Christmas.
And this year It won't be anything like, anything like.
Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me I've been an awful good girl, santa baby.
So hurry down the chimney tonight.
Santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue well I'll wait up for you, dear, santa baby.
So hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah think of all the fun I've missed.
Think of all the boys I haven't kissed next year I could be just as good If you check off my Christmas list.
Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot I've been an angel all year, santa baby.
Santa, honey, there's one more thing I really do need, the deed.
To a platinum mine, santa honey come and trim my Christmas tree.
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's I really do believe in you let's see if you believe in me.
Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing a ring.
And I don't mean on the phone, santa baby silent night, holy night all is calm and all is bright.
Round yon virgin mother and child.
Holy infant so tender and mild sleep in heavenly peace shepherds quake at the sight.
Glories stream from Heaven afar heavenly hosts sing halleluia christ the savior is born.
Christ our savior is born son of God.
Love's pure light.
Radiant beams from thy holy face with the dawn of redeeming grace.
Jesus Lord at thy birth.
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas.
Just like the ones I used to know where the tree tops glisten and children listen.
To hear sleigh bells in the snow with every Christmas card I write may your days be merry and bright.
And may all your Christmases be white.
So may your days be merry and bright I see your face in my mind as I drive away cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way.
People are people, and sometimes we change our minds.
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time.
Mmm mmm mmm.
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm.
Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see.
Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down now I don't know what to be without you around.
And we know it's never simple, never easy.
Never a clean break, no one here to save me.
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand and I can't breathe without you.
But I have to.
Breathe without you never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt.
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve.
People are people, and sometimes it doesn't work out.
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out.
It's two A.M.
Feelin' like I just lost a friend.
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me.
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me.
I'm sorry (oh) I'm sorry (mmm).
I'm sorry (eh eh) I'm sorry and its a sad picture.
The final blow hits you.
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and you know its all the same.
Another time and place.
Repeating history and youre getting sick of it.
But I believe in whatever you do and Ill do anything to see it through.
Because these things will change.
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down.
This revolution, the time will come for us to finally win.
And well sing hallelujah, well sing hallelujah so weve been outnumbered.
Raided and now cornered Its hard to fight when the fight aint fair.
Were getting stronger now find things they never found.
They might be bigger.
But were faster and never scared you can walk away, say we dont need this but theres something in your eyes says we can beat this.
'Cause these things will change and well sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah tonight we'll stand, get off our knees.
Fight for what weve worked for all these years and the battle was long, its the fight of our lives but well stand up champions tonight.
It was the night things changed can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down this revolution, throw your hands up 'Cause we never gave in.
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah I could go back to every laugh.
But I don't wanna' go there anymore and I know all the steps up to your door.
But I don't wanna' go there anymore.
Talk to the wind, talk to the sky.
Talk to the man with the reasons why.
And let me know what you find.
Ill leave my window open cause Im too tired at night to call your name.
Just know Im right here hopin.
That youll come in with the rain.
I could stand up and sing you a song but I dont wanna have to go that far.
And I, Ive got you down I know you by heart and you dont even know where I start.
Talk to yourself, talk to the tears.
Talk to the man who put you here and dont wait for the sky to clear.
Cus Im too tired at night to call your name.
Oh, just know Im right here hopin.
Ive watched you so long screamed your name I dont know what else I can say.
But Ill leave my window open cus Im too tired at night for all these games.
But I dont wanna go there anymore.
There's somethin' 'bout the way the street looks when it's just rained.
There's a glow off the pavement.
You walk me to the car and you know I wanna ask you to dance right there In the middle of the parking lot.
Oh yeah we're drivin' down the road.
I wonder if you know I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now.
But you're just so cool run your hands through your hair.
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you and I don't know how it gets better than this you take my hand and drag me head first.
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress so, baby, drive slow.
'Til we run out of road in this one horse town.
I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat you put your eyes on me.
In this moment now capture it, remember it 'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this.
Well, you stood there with me in the doorway.
My hands shake.
I'm not usually this way.
But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave It's the first kiss.
It's flawless really something.
It's fearless.
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors It's the morning of your very first day you say "Hi" to your friends you ain't seen in a while.
Try and stay out of everybody's way It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here.
For the next four years in this town hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say "You know I haven't seen you around before.".
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you you're gonna believe them.
And when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out.
Well, count to ten, take it in this is life before you know who you're gonna be.
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail and soon enough you're best friends.
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool.
We'll be out of here as soon as we can and then you're on your very first date and he's got a car.
And you're feeling like flying and your mamma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one.
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends.
When the night ends when you're fifteen.
And your first kiss makes your head spin round but in your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy on the football team.
But I didn't know it at fifteen when all you wanted was to be wanted wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now.
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday.
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine.
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind and we both cried don't forget to look before you fall.
I've found time can heal most anything and you just might find who you're supposed to be.
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
Your very first day take a deep breath, girl take a deep breath as you walk through the doors.
Once upon a time I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye and we caught onto something.
I hold onto the night you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me.
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down.
We almost never speak.
I don't feel welcome anymore.
Baby, what happened, please tell me?
'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're half way out the door and I stare at the phone.
He still hasn't called.
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all.
And you flashback to when he said forever and always oh, and it rains in your bedroom.
Everything is wrong.
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone 'Cause I was there when you said forever and always was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest?
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes.
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure.
So here's to everything coming down to nothing here's to silence.
That cuts me to the core.
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore and then you feel so low, you can't feel nothing at all you didn't mean it, baby.
I don't think so.
Back up, baby, back up did you forget everything?
'Cause it rains in your bedroom oh, I stare at the phone and then you feel so low.
You can't feel nothing at all and you flashback to when we said forever and always and it rains in your bedroom.
You said forever and always... yeah you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me.
Were you just kidding cause it seems to me.
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak baby, what happened, please tell me cause one second it was perfect.
Now you're half way out the door and you flashback to.
When he said forever and always It rains when you're here.
And it rains when you're gone I was there when you said forever and always.
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy thought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure so here's to everything coming down to nothing.
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core.
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore you didn't mean it baby I don't think so, oh oh oh.
Back up, baby back up.
Please back up, oh back up.
Cause it rains in your bedroom when we said forever and always.
You said forever and always, yeah hey Stephen.
I know looks can be deceiving but I know I saw a light in you.
And as we walked we were talking.
I didn't say half the things I wanted to.
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window.
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold.
Boy, you might have me believing I don't always have to be alone.
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.
Can't help it if there's no one else.
Mmm, I can't help myself.
I've been holding back this feeling.
So I've got some things to say to you, ha.
I seen it all so I thought but I never seen nobody shine the way you do.
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change.
Why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same.
They're dimming the street lights.
You're perfect for me, why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out and pull me near to shine, shine, shine.
I could give you fifty reasons.
Why I should be the one you choose.
All those other girls.
Well, they're beautiful but would they write a song for you?
I can't help it if you look like an angel mmm, I can't help myself...
...if you look like an angel.
Can't help myself I can't help myself.
I like the way you sound in the morning.
We're on the phone and without a warning I realize your laugh is the best sound.
I have ever heard I like the way I can't keep my focus I watch you talk, you didn't notice.
I hear the words but all I can think is we should be together every time you smile, I smile.
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you whoa, oh, I'm feeling you baby.
Don't be afraid to.
Jump then fall.
Jump then fall into me be there, never gonna leave you say that you wanna be with me too.
So I'mma stay through it all so jump then fall.
Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face you got the keys to me.
I love each freckle on your face, oh I've never been so wrapped up, honey.
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted I had time to think it all over and all I can say is come closer.
Take a deep breath then jump then fall into me.
Cause Every time you smile, I smile the bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet.
I'll catch you, I'll catch you and people say things that bring you to your knees.
I'll catch you.
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry but I'll hold you through the night until you smile.
Whoa, oh, I need you baby.
Don't be afraid, please jump then fall, baby.
Jump then fall into me, into me.
And every time you shine, I shine and every time you're here.
Baby I'll show you, I'll show you you can Jump then fall, jump then fall jump then fall into me, into me, yeah.
We were both young when I first saw you.
I close my eyes and the flashback starts I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air.
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns.
See you make your way through the crowd and say, "Hello." little did I know...
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles.
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet." and I was crying on the staircase begging you, "Please don't go.".
And I said...
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes".
So I sneak out to the garden to see you.
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew so close your eyes escape this town for a little while.
Oh, oh.
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter.
But you were everything to me I was begging you, "Please don't go.".
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.
Romeo, save me. They're trying to tell me how to feel.
This love is difficult but it's real.
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.
Oh, oh, oh.
I got tired of waiting wondering if you were ever coming around.
My faith in you was fading.
When I met you on the outskirts of town.
Romeo, save me. I've been feeling so alone.
I keep waiting for you, but you never come.
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think.
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...
Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone.
I love you, and that's all I really know.
I talked to your dad  go pick out a white dress oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you this is wrong but I can't help but feel like.
There ain't nothing more right babe misty morning comes again and I can't.
Help but wish I could see your face and I knew from the first note played I'd be breaking all my rules to see you.
You smile that beautiful smile and.
All the girls in the front row scream your name so dim that spotlight, tell me things like I can't take my eyes off of you.
I'm no one special, just another wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar.
Good morning loneliness, comes around when I'm not.
Dreaming about you when my world wakes up today you'll be in another town.
And I knew when I saw your face, I'd be.
Counting down the ways to see you you played in bars, you play guitar I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are.
And you'll never see, sing me to sleep every night from the radio.
Sweet, sweet superstar, superstar I took a chance, I took a shot.
And you might think i'm bulletproof, but i'm not you took a swing, I took it hard.
And down here from the ground I see who you are I'm sick and tired of your attitude.
I'm feeling like I don't know you you tell me that you love me then you cut me down.
And I need you like a heartbeat but you know you got a mean streak makes me run for cover when you're around.
And here's to you and your temper yes, I remember what you said last night and I know that you see what you're doing to me.
Tell me why..
You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day well I get so confused and frustrated.
Forget what i'm trying to say, oh I'm sick and tired of your reasons.
I got no one to believe in.
You tell me that you want me, then push me around here's to you and your temper.
Why..do you have to make me feel small so you can feel whole inside why..do you have to put down my dreams.
So you're the only thing on my mind you tell me that you want me then cut me down I've got no one to believe in.
You ask me for my love then you push me around tell me why why, tell me why.
I take a step back, let you go.
I told you i'm not bulletproof.
Now you know.
I'm five years old It's getting cold.
I've got my big coat on I hear your laugh.
And look up smiling at you I run and run past the pumpkin patch.
And the tractor rides look now -- the sky is gold.
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home I don't know why all the trees change in the fall.
I know you're not scared of anything at all don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away.
But I know I had the best day with you today I'm thirteen now.
And don't know how my friends could be so mean I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys.
And we drive and drive until we've found a town far enough away.
And we talk and window-shop.
Until I've forgotten all their names I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school.
I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay.
I have an excellent father his strength is making me stronger god smiles on my little brother.
Inside and out.
He's better than I am.
I grew up in a pretty house.
And I had space to run and I had the best days with you there is a video.
I found from back when I was three.
You set up a paint set in the kitchen.
And you're talking to me It's the age of princesses and pirate ships.
And the seven dwarfs daddy's smart.
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world now I know why all the trees change in the fall I know you were on my side.
Even when I was wrong and I love you for giving me your eyes staying back and watching me shine.
And I didn't know if you knew.
So I'm taking this chance to say.
That I had the best day.
In the heat of the fight I walked away Ignoring words that you were saying trying to make me stay.
I said, "This time I've had enough." and you've called a hundred times but I'm not picking up.
'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over.
But if you look a little closer I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you.
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles.
Screaming, "I'm in love with you." wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more.
And don't you leave 'cause I know.
All I need is on the other side of the door me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone.
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone.
I keep going back over things we both said.
And I remember the slamming door and all the things that I misread.
So babe if you know everything, tell me why you couldn't see.
When I left I wanted you to chase after me yeah, I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you.
And I'll scream out the window I can't even look at you I don't need you but I do, I do, I do.
I say, "There's nothing you can say to make this right again.
I mean it, I mean it.".
What I mean is...
I said, "Leave," but baby all I want is you with your face and the beautiful eyes and the conversation with the little white lies.
And the faded picture of a beautiful night you carry me from your car up the stairs.
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress after everything I must confess, I need you.
He is sensible and so incredible.
And all my single friends are jealous he says everything I need to hear and it's like I couldn't ask for anything better.
He opens up my door and I get into his car and he says you look beautiful tonight and I feel perfectly fine.
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain and it's 2am and I'm cursing your name you're so in love that you act insane.
And that's the way I loved you breakin' down and coming undone It's a roller coaster kinda rush.
And I never knew I could feel that much.
He respects my space and never makes me wait and he calls exactly when he says he will.
He's close to my mother.
Talks business with my father he's charming and endearing and I'm comfortable.
He can't see the smile I'm faking and my heart's not breaking cause I'm not feeling anything at all.
And you were wild and crazy just so frustrating intoxicating.
Complicated, got away by some mistake and now.
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain It's 2am and I'm cursing your name.
I'm so in love that I acted insane.
Breaking down and coming undone and that's the way I loved you oh, oh never knew I could feel that much.
Untouchable like a distant diamond sky, Mmmm I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why.
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you.
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun and when you're close I feel like coming undone.
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream It's like a million little stars.
Spelling out your name you gotta come on, come on say that we'll be together.
Come on, come on little taste of Heaven.
It's half full and I won't wait here all day I know you're saying that you'll be here anyway but you're untouchable.
Burning brighter than the sun.
Now that you're close I feel like coming undone oh, In the middle of the night.
Waking from this dream I wanna feel you by my side.
Standing next to me.
Oh, oh I'm caught up in you.
Oh, oh, oh untouchable burning brighter than the sun.
Come on, come on, oh oh oh, Oh, In the middle of the night.
Like a million little stars, spelling out your name say you're sorry.
That face of an angel comes out just when you need it to as I paced back and forth all this time.
'Cause I honestly believed in you holding on.
The days drag on.
Stupid girl I should have known, I should have known that I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale.
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet lead her up the stairwell this ain't Hollywood, this is a small town.
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around maybe I was nave.
Got lost in your eyes and never really had a chance.
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love.
You had to fight to have the upper hand I had so many dreams about you and me.
Happy endings.
Now I know.
And there you are on your knees begging for forgiveness, begging for me just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry.
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well this is a big world, that was a small town.
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now.
And it's too late for you and your white horse.
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to catch me now oh, whoa, whoa, whoa try and catch me now.
Oh, it's too late to catch me now.
All this time I was wasting.
Hoping you would come around I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down.
And it's taken me this long baby but I figured you out.
And you're thinking we'll be fine again but not this time around.
You don't have to call anymore I won't pick up the phone this is the last straw.
Don't wanna hurt anymore and you can tell me that you're sorry but I don't believe you baby.
Like I did before you're not sorry, no no oh.
Looking so innocent.
I might believe you if I didn't know could've loved you all my life.
If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold and you got your share of secrets.
And I'm tired of being last to know and now you're asking me to listen cause it's worked each time before.
But you don't have to call anymore you're not sorry, no no, oh.
You're not sorry no no oh you had me crying for you honey and it never would've gone away, no.
You used to shine so bright.
But I watched all of it fade so you don't have to call anymore.
There's nothing left to beg for.
You're on the phone with your girlfriend she's upset, she's going off about something that you said 'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do.
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night.
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.
And she'll never know your story like I do.
But she wears short skirts I wear t-shirts she's cheer captain.
And I'm on the bleachers.
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find that what you're looking for has been here the whole time.
If you could see that I'm the one.
Who understands you.
Been here all along.
So, why can't you see.
You belong with me.
You belong with me.
Walk in the streets with you in your worn out jeans.
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself.
"Hey, isn't this easy?" and you've got a smile that could light up this whole town.
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down.
You say you're fine I know you better than that.
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?
She wears high heels.
I wear sneakers.
And I'm on the bleachers.
Who understands you standing by and waiting at your backdoor.
All this time how could you not know, baby?
Oh, I remember you driving to my house In the middle of the night.
I'm the one who makes you laugh when you know you're 'bout to cry.
I know your favorite songs and you tell me about your dreams.
Think I know where you belong think I know it's with me.
Can't you see who understands you?
Have you ever thought just maybe you belong with me?
I'm so glad you made time to see me.
How's life? Tell me how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while.
You've been good, busier than ever.
We small talk, work and the weather your guard is up and I know why.
Because the last time you saw me Is still burned in the back of your mind.
You gave me roses and I left them there to die.
So this is me swallowing my pride.
Standing in front of you saying, "I'm sorry for that night," and I go back to December all the time.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you.
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.
I go back to December all the time.
These days I haven't been sleeping staying up, playing back myself leavin'.
When your birthday passed and I didn't call.
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times I watched you laughing from the passenger side.
Realized I loved you in the fall.
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind you gave me all your love and all I gave you was "Goodbye".
Standing in front of you saying, "I'm sorry for that night." It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you.
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile so good to me, so right.
And how you held me in your arms that September night.
The first time you ever saw me cry.
Maybe this is wishful thinking.
Probably mindless dreaming.
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right.
I'd go back in time and change it but I can't.
So if the chain is on your door I understand.
But this is me swallowing my pride.
And I go back to December...
All the time.
"Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did" time for a little revenge.
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and...
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him she came along, got him alone and let's hear the applause.
She took him faster than you could say "sabotage".
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it.
I underestimated just who I was dealing with she had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum she underestimated just who she was stealing from.
She's not a saint and she's not what you think she's an actress, whoa.
She's better known for the things that she does on the mattress, whoa.
Soon she's gonna find.
Stealing other people's toys on the playground won't.
Make you many friends she should keep in mind.
There is nothing I do better than revenge she looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list.
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it.
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling.
And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things but sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know.
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go.
They wouldn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me.
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity I'm just another thing for you.
To roll your eyes at, honey you might have him but haven't you heard.
You might have him but I always get the last word.
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do. Oh.
I don't think you do let's hear the applause.
Come on show me how much better you are (so much better, yeah) so you deserve some applause 'cause you're so much better long were the nights when.
My days once revolved around you.
Counting my footsteps.
Praying the floor wont fall through, again and my mother accused me of losing my mind.
But I swore I was fine you paint me a blue sky.
And go back and turn it to rain.
And I lived in your chess game but you changed the rules everyday wonderin which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight.
Well I stopped pickin up and this song is to let you know why.
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home, I should've known.
Well maybe its me and my blind optimism to blame or maybe its you and your sick need.
To give love then take it away and you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand.
And I'll look back in regret how I ignored when they said "Run as fast as you can.".
Cried the whole way home.
Dear John, I see it all now it was wrong dont you think nineteens too young.
To be played by your dark, twisted games?
When I loved you so, I should've known.
You are an expert at "Sorry" and keeping lines blurry never impressed by me acing your tests.
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes cause you've burned them out.
But I took your matches.
Before fire could catch me.
So dont look now Im shining like fireworks.
Over your sad empty town.
I see it all now that you're gone.
Wrote you a song, you shouldve known.
You shouldve known dont you think I was too young?
You shouldve known.
There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles same old tired lonely place.
Walls of insincerity shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face.
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you your eyes whispered, "Have we met?" across the room your silhouette.
Starts to make its way to me.
The playful conversation starts.
Counter all your quick remarks like passing notes in secrecy and it was enchanting to meet you.
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you this night is sparkling, don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home.
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew I was enchanted to meet you the lingering question kept me up.
2 AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake.
And now I'm pacing back and forth.
Wishing you were at my door I'd open up and you would say, "Hey.
It was enchanting to meet you.
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you." this night is flawless, don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone.
This is me praying that this was the very first page not where the story line ends.
My thoughts will echo your name.
Until I see you again these are the words I held back.
As I was leaving too soon please don't be in love with someone else please don't have somebody waiting on you.
You and I walk a fragile line I have known it all this time but I never thought I'd live to see it break.
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet and I can't trust anything now and it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake.
Oh, I'm holding my breath.
Won't lose you again something's made your eyes go cold come on, come on, don't leave me like this.
I thought I had you figured out.
Something's gone terribly wrong you're all I wanted.
Can't breathe whenever you're gone.
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted.
Stood there and watched you walk away.
From everything we had but I still mean every word I said to you he will try to take away my pain.
And he just might make me smile but the whole time I'm wishing he was you instead.
Won't see you again something keeps me holding on to nothing.
I know, I know, I just know you're not gone. You can't be gone. No.
Won't finish what you started can't go back, I'm haunted never ever thought I'd see it break.
Never thought I'd see it...
Last night I heard my own heart beating.
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs six months gone and I'm still reaching.
Even though I know you're not there I was playing back a thousand memories, baby.
Thinking 'bout everything we've been through.
Maybe I've been going back too much lately.
When time stood still and I had you.
Come back, come back, come back to me like.
You would, you would if this was a movie stand in the rain outside 'til I came out you could, you could if you just said you're sorry.
I know that we could work it out somehow but if this was a movie you'd be here by now I know people change and these things happen.
But I remember how it was back then locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing.
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them.
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street flashback to the night when you said to me.
"Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you not before I knew how much I had to lose.".
If you're out there If you're somewhere If you're moving on.
I've been waiting for you.
Ever since you've been gone I just want it back the way it was before.
And I just wanna see you back at my front door.
And I'd say you would before you said, "It's not that easy.".
Before the fight, before I locked you out but I take it all back now you'd be here by now.
It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now.
Baby, what about the ending.
Oh, I thought you'd be here by now, whoa.
Thought you'd be here by now I guess you really did it this time.
Left yourself in your warpath lost your balance on a tightrope lost your mind tryin' to get it back.
Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into.
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything and everybody believed in you?
It's alright, just wait and see.
Your string of lights is still bright to me oh, who you are is not where you've been.
You're still an innocent.
You're still an innocent.
Did some things you can't speak of.
But at night you live it all again you wouldn't be shattered on the floor now.
If only you had seen what you know now then.
Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days?
When everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep before the monsters caught up to you?
Oh, who you are is not what you've been.
It's okay, life is a tough crowd 32, and still growin' up now.
Who you are is not what you did.
Time turns flames to embers you'll have new Septembers every one of us has messed up too.
Minds change like the weather I hope you remember.
Today is never too late to be brand new who you are is not what you did lost your balance on a tightrope.
It's never too late to get it back.
I still remember the look on your face.
Lit through the darkness at 158 the words that you whispered for just us to know.
You told me you loved me so why did you go away?
I do recall now the smell of the rain fresh on the pavement.
I ran off the plane that July 9th the beat of your heart.
It jumps through your shirt I can still feel your arms but now I'll go sit on the floor.
Wearing your clothes all that I know is I don't know how to be something you miss.
I never thought we'd have a last kiss.
Never imagined we'd end like this your name, forever the name on my lips I do remember the swing of your step.
The life of the party, you're showing off again.
And I roll my eyes and then you pull me in I'm not much for dancing.
But for you I did.
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets how you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something.
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions and I'll go sit on the floor.
Never thought we'd have a last kiss.
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep.
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe.
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are hope it's nice where you are.
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day.
And something reminds you.
You wish you had stayed.
You can plan for a change in weather and time.
But I never planned on you changing your mind.
So I'll go sit on the floor just like our last kiss forever the name on my lips.
Just like our last...
I said remember this moment in the back of my mind the time we stood with our shaking hands.
The crowds in stands went wild.
We were the Kings and the Queens and they read off our names the night you danced like you knew our lives.
Would never be the same you held your head like a hero.
On a history book page It was the end of a decade.
But the start of an age long live the walls we crashed through how the kingdom lights shined just for me and you.
I was screaming long live all the magic we made.
And bring on all the pretenders one day, we will be remembered.
I said remember this feeling I pass the pictures around of all the years that we stood there.
On the side-lines wishing for right now.
We are the Kings and the Queens.
You traded your baseball cap for a crown when they gave us our trophies.
And we held them up for our town and the cynics were outraged.
Screaming, "This is absurd!" cause for a moment a band of thieves.
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world.
I'm not afraid long live all the mountains we moved.
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you I was screaming long live that look on your face.
Hold on to spinning around confetti falls to the ground may these memories break our fall.
Will you take a moment, promise me this that you'll stand by me forever.
But if God forbid fate should step in.
And force us into a goodbye If you have children some day.
When they point to the pictures.
Please tell them my name tell them how the crowds went wild.
Tell them how I hope they shine I had the time of my life, with you long, long live the walls we crashed through.
And I was screaming long live all the magic we made.
Singing, long live all the mountains we moved and long, long live the look on your face.
You, with your words like knives and swords and weapons that you use against me you have knocked me off my feet again.
Got me feeling like a nothing.
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard calling me out when I'm wounded.
You, picking on the weaker man well you can take me down with just one single blow.
But you don't know, what you don't know...
Someday I'll be living in a big ole city and all you're ever gonna be is mean someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me.
Why you gotta be so mean?
You, with your switching sides and your wildfire lies and your humiliation you have pointed out my flaws again.
As if I don't already see them.
I walk with my head down trying to block you out 'cause I'll never impress you.
I just wanna feel okay again.
I bet you got pushed around somebody made you cold.
But the cycle ends right now 'Cause you can't lead me down that road.
And you don't know, what you don't know...
And I can see you years from now in a bar talking over a football game.
With that same big loud opinion.
But nobody's listening washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things.
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing but all you are is mean all you are is mean.
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean.
But someday I'll be living in a big ole city.
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah why you gotta be so?...
Someday I'll be living in a big ole city (Why you gotta be so?...) and all you're ever gonna be is mean (Why you gotta be so?...).
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me (Why you gotta be so?...) uh, oh, oh.
You were in college working part time waiting tables left a small town, never looked back.
I was a flight risk with a fear of fallin wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts I say, "Can you believe it?".
As were lying on the couch the moment I can see it.
Yes, yes, I can see it now.
Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time.
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter.
You are the best thing thats ever been mine.
Flash forward and were taking on the world together and theres a drawer of my things at your place.
You learn my secrets and you figure out why Im guarded.
You say well never make my parents mistakes.
But we got bills to pay.
We got nothing figured out.
When it was hard to take.
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about.
You put your arm around me for the first time.
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time and I remember that fight two-thirty AM.
As everything was slipping right out of our hands I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street braced myself for the "Goodbye.".
Cause thats all Ive ever known.
Then you took me by surprise you said, "Ill never leave you alone.".
You said, "I remember how we felt sitting by the water.
And every time I look at you, its like the first time.
I fell in love with a careless mans careful daughter.
She is the best thing thats ever been mine." hold on, make it last hold on, never turn back.
(Hold on) do you believe it?
(Hold on) we're gonna make it now.
(Hold on) and I can see it (Yes, yes) I can see it now (see it now, see it now...) your little hand's wrapped around my finger.
And it's so quiet in the world tonight your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming so I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light.
To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret I'd give all I have, honey.
If you could stay like that oh darling, don't you ever grow up don't you ever grow up, just stay this little.
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple.
I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart.
And no one will desert you.
Just try to never grow up, never grow up you're in the car on the way to the movies.
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off at 14 there's just so much you can't do and you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots.
But don't make her drop you off around the block remember that she's getting older too.
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school.
No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred.
And even though you want to, just try to never grow up.
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home.
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said.
And all your little brother's favorite songs I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone so here I am in my new apartment.
In a big city, they just dropped me off.
It's so much colder than I thought it would be so I tuck myself in and turn my night light on.
Wish I'd never grown up I wish I'd never grown up oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up.
I could still be little It could still be simple.
Won't let nobody hurt you won't let no one break your heart and even though you want to, please try to never grow up.
Oh, don't you ever grow up.
Oh, never grow up, just never grow up elevator buttons and morning air.
Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares.
But right now my time is theirs seems like there's always someone who disapproves.
They'll judge it like they know about me and you and the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do.
The jury's out, but my choice is you.
So don't you worry your pretty little mind.
People throw rocks at things that shine and life makes love look hard the stakes are high, the water's rough.
But this love is ours you never know what people have up their sleeves ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me.
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles but I don't care 'cause right now you're mine and you'll say.
Don't you worry your pretty little mind and it's not theirs to speculate If it's wrong and.
Your hands are tough but they are where mine belong and.
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you 'Cause I love the gap between your teeth.
And I love the riddles that you speak.
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored 'Cause my heart is yours but they can't take what's ours.
They can't take what's ours the way you move is like a full-on rainstorm and I'm a house of cards.
You're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin'.
But I kinda know that I won't get far and you stood there in front of me just close enough to touch.
Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinking of.
Drop everything now meet me in the pouring rain kiss me on the sidewalk.
Take away the pain.
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around.
My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea.
You touch me once and it's really something.
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be.
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world but with you I know it's no good and I could wait patiently but I really wish you would...
I'll run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild.
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right.
And lead me up the staircase won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show.
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile.
And the sparks fly...
Oh, baby, smile...
I am not the kind of girl who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion.
But you are not the kind of boy.
Who should be marrying the wrong girl I sneak in and see your friends and her snotty little family all dressed in pastel.
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid somewhere back inside a room.
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry this is surely not what you thought it would be I lose myself in a daydream.
Where I stand and say.
Dont say "Yes", run away now.
Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door.
Dont wait or say a single vow you need to hear me out.
And they said, "Speak now." fond gestures are exchanged and the organ starts to play.
A song that sounds like a death march and I am hiding in the curtains.
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be.
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen.
But I know you wish it was me.
You wish it was me dont you?
Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door.
Your time is running out oh, la, la oh, oh.
Say a single vow.
I hear the preacher say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace." theres the silence, theres my last chance.
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me.
Horrified looks from everyone in the room but Im only looking at you.
So, dont say "Yes", run away now and you say, "Lets run away now.
Ill meet you when Im out of my tux at the back door.
Baby, I didnt say my vows.
So glad you were around.
When they said, "Speak now." tall, dark and superman.
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away to save the world or go to work It's the same thing to me.
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him.
I hang on every word you say, yay and you smile and say, "How are you? ".
I say, "Just fine".
I always forget to tell you, I love you, I love you... forever I watch superman fly away.
You've got a busy day today go save the world, I'll be around.
Come back I'll be with you someday.
I'll be right here on the ground.
When you come back down.
Tall, dark and beautiful.
He's complicated, he's irrational.
But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'.
He's not all bad like his reputation and I can't hear one single word they say.
And you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be OK I always forget to tell you I love you, I loved you from the very first day.
Go save the world I'll be around.
And I watch you fly around the world and I hope you don't save some other girl don't forget, don't forget about me.
I'm far away but I never let you go I'm lovestruck and looking out the window don't forget, don't forget where I'll be.
Right here wishing the flowers were from you wishing the card was from you wishing the call was from you.
'Cause I loved you from the very first day go save the world, I'll be around...
Forever and ever here I swear I'll be with you someday la, la, la, la, la, la.
I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us how we met and the sparks flew instantly and people would say, "They're the lucky ones.".
I used to know my place was the spot next to you now I'm searching the room for an empty seat 'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on.
Oh, a simple complication miscommunications lead to fall-out.
So many things that I wish you knew.
So many walls up I can't break through.
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking.
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.
Next chapter.
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy and you're doing your best to avoid me.
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us how I was losing my mind when I saw you here.
But you held your pride like you should've held me.
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how I've never heard silence quite this loud.
This is looking like a contest of who can act like they care less.
But I liked it better when you were on my side.
The battle's in your hands now but I would lay my armor down If you said you'd rather love than fight.
So many things that you wish I knew but the story of us might be ending soon.
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now.
And we're not speaking I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate 'cause we're going down the end.
It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters and make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh.
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight.
To fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uh.
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time.
It's miserable and magical.
Oh, yeah tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines.
It's time uh oh!
I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22.
Everything will be alright If you keep me next to you you don't know about me.
But I'll bet you want to If we just keep dancing like we're.
22, ooh-ooh It seems like one of those nights this place is too crowded.
Too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh (who's Taylor Swift anyway, ew?) we ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming Instead of sleeping.
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks.
Uh oh! (hey!).
Everything will be alright (alright) 22, ooh-ooh (oh, oh, oh).
It feels like one of those nights.
We ditch the whole scene.
We won't be sleeping.
You look like bad news.
I gotta have you I gotta have you.
Ooh-ooh, ye-e-e-e-eah, hey.
I don't know about you (I don't know about you) you don't know about me (you don't know about me).
22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah 22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah we ditch the whole scene.
We won't be sleeping you look like bad news I walked through the door with you, the air was cold.
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow.
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house.
And you've still got it in your drawer even now.
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze.
We're singing in the car, getting lost Upstate.
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place and I can picture it after all these days.
And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more.
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all.
'Cause there we are again on that little town street.
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me.
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well.
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red.
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed.
And your mother's telling stories about you on a tee ball team you taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me.
And there was nothing else I could do and I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to...
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night.
We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah.
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much but maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up.
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well.
Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise.
So casually cruel in the name of being honest.
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here.
'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well.
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own.
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone but you keep my old scarf from that very first week.
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me.
You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah 'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so.
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all.
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all took a deep breath in the mirror he didn't like it when I wore high heels.
But I do turn the lock and put my headphones on.
He always said he didn't get this song but I do, I do walked in expecting you'd be late.
But you got here early and you stand and wave I walk to you.
You pull my chair out and help me in.
And you don't know how nice that is and you throw your head back laughing like a little kid I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did.
I've been spending the last eight months.
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end but on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again.
You said you never met one girl who had as many James Taylor records as you.
We tell stories and you don't know why.
I'm coming off a little shy but you throw your head back laughing like a little kid and we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up.
But you start to talk about the movies that your family every single Christmas and I want to talk about that and for the first time what's past is past.
'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid.
You said it in a simple way.
4 AM, the second day how strange that I don't know you at all.
Stumbled through the long goodbye one last kiss, then catch your flight.
Right when I was just about to fall I told myself, "Don't get attached," but in my mind I play it back.
Spinning faster than the plane that took you...
And this is when the feeling sinks in I don't wanna miss you like this.
Come back... be here, come back... be here.
I guess you're in New York today.
I don't wanna need you this way.
The delicate beginning rush the feeling you can know so much without knowing anything at all.
And now that I can't put this down.
If I had known what I'd known now I never would have played so nonchalant.
Taxi cabs and busy streets that never bring you back to me I can't help but wish you took me with you...
I guess you're in London today this is falling in love in the cruelest way.
This is falling for you when you are worlds away.
New York... be here.
But you're in London and I break down 'Cause it's not fair that you're not around.
This is when the feeling sinks in and I don't wanna need you this way I don't wanna miss you like this.
Come back... be here.
(duet with Ed Sheeran) all I knew this morning when I woke Is I know something now, know something now I didn't before.
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago Is green eyes and freckles and your smile In the back of my mind making me feel like.
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now I just wanna know you, know you, know you 'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello.".
And your eyes look like coming home.
All I know is a simple name.
Everything has changed all I know is you held the door you'll be mine and I'll be yours.
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed and all my walls stood tall painted blue.
And I'll take them down, take them down and open up the door for you and all I feel in my stomach is butterflies.
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time taking flight, making me feel right taking flight, making me feel right like.
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours.
Come back and tell me why I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time, oh, oh, oh.
And meet me there tonight and let me know that it's not all in my mind.
All I know is we said, "Hello." so dust off your highest hopes.
All I know is pouring rain and everything has changed all I know is a new found grace all my days I'll know your face.
Don't look at me.
You've got a girl at home.
And everybody knows that everybody knows that.
Uh, uh.
And everybody knows that.
I don't even know her but I feel a responsibility to do what's upstanding and right.
It's kinda like a code, yeah and you've been getting closer and closer and crossing so many lines.
And it would be a fine proposition If I was a stupid girl but honey I am no-one's exception.
This I have previously learned.
So don't look at me I see you turn off your phone.
And now you got me alone and I say.
Everybody knows that.
I just wanna make sure you understand perfectly you're the kind of man who makes me sad.
While she waits up you chase down the newest thing.
And take for granted what you have.
And yeah I might go with it If I hadn't once been just like her.
And now you've got me alone call a cab lose my number.
You're about to lose your girl let's consider this lesson learned.
Wanna see you pick up your phone and tell her you're coming home.
It would be a fine proposition.
I was reminiscing just the other day.
While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away.
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York Time.
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme.
Took off faster than a green light "Go".
Yeah, you skipped the conversation when you already know.
I left a note on the door with a joke wed made and that was the first day.
And darling, it was good never looking down.
And right there where we stood was holy ground.
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress we had this big wide city all to ourselves.
We blocked the noise with the sound of I need you and for the first time I had something to lose and I guess we fell apart in the usual way.
And the storys got dust on every page.
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now.
And I see your face in every crowd.
Cause darling, it was good never looking down.
Tonight Im gonna dance for all that weve been through.
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you.
Tonight Im gonna dance like you were in this room.
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you It was good never looking down.
I bet this time of night you're still up.
I bet you're tired from a long hard week.
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me.
And I just wanna tell you.
It takes everything in me not to call you.
And I wish I could run to you.
And I hope you know that every time I don't.
I almost do I almost do.
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you 'Cause each time you reach out there's no reply.
I bet it never ever occurred to you that I can't say "Hello" to you.
And risk another goodbye.
Oh, we made quite a mess, babe.
It's probably better off this way.
And I confess, babe In my dreams you're touching my face.
And asking me if I wanna try again with you.
And I almost do.
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me.
I think--I think when it's all over.
It just comes back in flashes, you know?
It's like a kaleidoscope of memories.
It just all comes back. But he never does.
I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen.
It's not really anything he said or anything he did It was the feeling that came along with it.
And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again.
But I don't know if I should.
I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright.
But I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you?
Maybe he knew that when he saw me.
I guess I just lost my balance.
I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him.
It was losing me.
Once upon a time a few mistakes ago.
I was in your sights, you got me alone.
You found me, you found me, you found me I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that and when I fell hard you took a step back.
Without me, without me, without me.
And he's long gone when he's next to me.
And I realize the blame is on me.
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in so shame on me now.
Flew me to places I'd never been.
'Til you put me down, oh I knew you were trouble when you walked in now I'm lying on the cold hard ground.
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble no apologies. He'll never see you cry.
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why.
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning.
Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street a new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be and now I see, now I see, now I see.
He was long gone when he met me.
And I realize the joke is on me, yeah!
And the saddest fear comes creeping in that you never loved me or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah.
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (you were right there, you were right there) trouble, trouble, trouble.
I don't know if you know who you are until you lose who you are.
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly.
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all.
Losing him was blue like I'd never known missing him was dark grey all alone.
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met but loving him was red.
Loving him was red touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you.
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song.
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer.
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong.
Oh, red burning red remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes.
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go.
But moving on from him is impossible when I still see it all in my head In burning red.
Burning, it was red oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known 'Cause loving him was red.
Yeah, yeah, red we're burning red and that's why he's spinnin' 'round in my head.
Comes back to me, burning red.
Yeah, yeah his love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street long handwritten note deep in your pocket.
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait.
We had a beautiful magic love there what a sad beautiful tragic love affair In dreams I meet you in warm conversation.
We both wake in lonely beds in different cities and time is taking its sweet time erasing you.
And you've got your demons, and, darling, they all look like me 'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there.
Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting silence, this train runs off its tracks.
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up, for the life of us we can't get back.
A beautiful magic love there what a sad beautiful tragic, beautiful tragic, beautiful.
What we had  a beautiful magic love there.
I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune" It was the best night, never would forget how he moved.
The whole place was dressed to the nines.
And we were dancing, dancing like we're made of starlight I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45.
Picked me up late one night out the window we were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in.
The night we snuck into a yacht club party pretending to be a duchess and a prince.
And I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune.".
Like we're made of starlight, starlight he said, "Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change.
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way." he was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me.
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?".
Like "Oh my, what a marvelous tune." It was the best night, never would forget how he moved ooh ooh he's talking crazy.
Ooh ooh dancing with me.
Ooh ooh we could get married have ten kids and teach them how to dream oh my, what a marvelous tune.
Like we dream impossible dreams like starlight, starlight don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights busy streets and busy lives and all we know.
Is touch and go.
We are alone with our changing minds.
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time and I never (never) saw you coming and I'll never (never) be the same.
You come around and the armor falls.
Pierce the room like a cannonball now all we know is don't let go we are alone, just you and me.
Up in your room and our slates are clean just twin fire signs.
Four blue eyes so you were never a saint.
And Ive loved in shades of wrong we learn to live with the pain mosaic broken hearts.
But this love is brave and wild.
And I never (never)  saw you coming.
This is a state of grace this is the worthwhile fight love is a ruthless game.
Unless you play it good and right.
These are the hands of fate.
You're my Achilles heel.
This is the golden age of something good and right and real I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night.
I threw my phone across the room at you.
I was expecting some dramatic turn-away but you stayed.
This morning I said we should talk about it.
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved.
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said, "Okay, let's talk.".
And I said.
Stay, stay, stay.
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
But I think that it's best if we both stay.
Before you I'd only dated self-indulgent takers who took all of their problems out on me.
But you carry my groceries, and now I'm always laughin'.
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to...
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay.
You took the time to memorize me my fears, my hopes, and dreams.
I just like hangin' out with you all the time.
All those times that you didn't leave; It's been occurring to me I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life.
And I'll be loving you for quite some time.
No one else is gonna love me, when I get mad, mad, mad.
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.
That's so fun!
(feat. Gary Lightbody) I find myself at your door just like all those times before.
I'm not sure how I got there.
All roadsthey lead me here.
I imagine you are home.
In your room, all alone and you open your eyes into mine and everything feels better.
and right before your eyes I'm breaking, no past.
No reasons why just you and me.
This is the last time I'm asking you this.
Put my name at the top of your list this is the last time I'm asking you why.
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye.
You find yourself at my door you wear your best apology but I was there to watch you leave.
And all the times I let you in just for you to go again.
Disappear when you come back.
Everything is better.
I'm aching, no past nowhere to hide just you and me...
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye...
This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong this is the last time I say it's been you all along this is the last time I let you in my door.
This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore.
You break my heart in the blink of an eye.
This is the last time I'm asking you.
Last time I'm asking you last time I'm asking you this...
New to town with a made up name in the angel's city.
Chasing fortune and fame.
And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream.
You had it figured out since you were in school.
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool.
So overnight you look like a sixties queen.
Another name goes up in lights, like diamonds in the sky.
And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.
Yeah, theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.
But can you tell me now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh...
Now its big black cars, and Riviera views and your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you and your secrets end up splashed on the news front page.
And they tell you that youre lucky.
But youre so confused 'Cause you dont feel pretty, you just feel used.
And all the young things line up to take your place.
Another name goes up in lights. You wonder if youll make it out alive.
Can you tell me now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.
It was a few years later, I showed up here.
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared.
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out.
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square.
And it took some time, but I understand it now.
Cause now my name is up in lights, but I think you got it right let me tell you now, youre the lucky one.
Let me tell you now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.
Yeah theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one.
And theyll tell you now, youre the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, whoa, oh, oh you should've been there.
Should've burst through the door with that 'baby I'm right here' smile.
And it would've felt like a million little shining stars had just aligned and I would've been so happy.
Christmas lights glisten.
I've got my eye on the door just waiting for you to walk in but the time is ticking.
People ask me how I've been as I comb back through my memory how you said you'd be here.
You said you'd be here.
And it was like slow motion standing there in my party dress In red lipstick.
With no one to impress.
And they're all laughing as I'm looking around the room.
But there's one thing missing and that was the moment I knew.
And the hours pass by now I just wanna be alone.
But your close friends always seem to know when there's something really wrong.
So they follow me down the hall.
And there in the bathroom I try not to fall apart.
And the sinking feeling starts as I say hopelessly "He said he'd be here.".
And asking me about you.
But there was one thing missing what do you say when tears are streaming down your face.
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do when the one.
Who means the most to you Is the one who didn't show?
You should've been here.
And they're all standing around me singing.
"Happy birthday to you".
Ooh, I knew.
You called me later and said, "I'm sorry, I didn't make it," and I said, "I'm sorry too,".
Put your lips close to mine as long as they don't touch out of focus, eye to eye.
Till the gravity's too much.
And I'll do anything you say.
If you say it with your hands and I'd be smart to walk away.
But you're quicksand this slope is treacherous.
This path is reckless and I, I, I like it I can't decide if it's a choice.
Getting swept away I hear the sound of my own voice.
Asking you to stay.
And all we are is skin and bone trained to get along.
Forever going with the flow.
But you're friction.
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night and I will get you, and get you alone.
Your name has echoed through my mind and I just think you should, think you should know.
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I would.
Follow you, follow you home...
I'll follow you, follow you home...
This hope is treacherous this daydream is dangerous I, I, I... I, I, I... I, I, I...
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I will.
I, I, I like it I remember when we broke up the first time.
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like.
We hadn't seen each other in a month when you said you needed space. (What?).
Then you come around again and say "Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me.".
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you." ooh, we called it off again last night.
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you we are never ever ever getting back together you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me.
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together like, ever...
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights.
And me falling for it screaming that I'm right and you would hide away and find your peace of mind with some indie record that's much cooler than mine.
Ooh, you called me up again tonight.
We are never, ever, ever getting back together.
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me).
Ooh, yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah oh oh oh I used to think that we were forever ever.
And I used to say, "Never say never...".
Uggg... so he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you," and I'm like... "I just... I mean this is exhausting, you know, like.
We are never getting back together. Like, ever".
We, ooh, getting back together, ohhh we, ooh, getting back together people like you always want back the love they gave away.
And people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed.
The more I think about it now the less I know.
All I know is that you drove us off the road.
Hey, all you had to do was stay had me in the palm of your hand then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in.
Stay, hey, now you say you want it back now that it's just too late.
Well, it could've been easy all you had to do was stay here you are now, calling me up, but I don't know what to say.
I've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made people like you always want back the love they pushed aside but people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye.
Let me remind.
You this was what you wanted you ended it you were all I wanted.
But not like this not like this oh, all you had to do was stay.
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood you know it used to be mad love so take a look what you've done.
Now we got problems and I don't think we can solve them.
You made a really deep cut and, baby, now we got bad blood did you have to do this? I was thinking that you could be trusted.
Did you have to ruin what was shiny? Now it's all rusted did you have to hit me, where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe and rub it in so deep, salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me.
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I.
Did you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my back from your knife so don't think it's in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
Now did you think it all through? All these things will catch up to you and time can heal but this won't, so if you're coming my way, just don't.
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes.
You say sorry just for show If you live like that, you live with ghosts (ghosts) band-aids don't fix bullet holes (hey).
You say sorry just for show (hey) If you live like that, you live with ghosts (hey).
If you love like that blood runs cold.
You know it used to be mad love (mad love) and I don't think we can solve them (think we can solve them) so take a look what you've done (look what you've done).
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things magic, madness, heaven, sin.
Saw you there and I thought oh my God, look at that face.
You look like my next mistake love's a game, wanna play?
New money, suit and tie I can read you like a magazine ain't it funny, rumors fly.
And I know you heard about me so hey, let's be friends.
I'm dying to see how this one ends grab your passport and my hand.
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend.
So it's gonna be forever.
Or it's gonna go down in flames.
You can tell me when it's over.
If the high was worth the pain.
Got a long list of ex-lovers they'll tell you I'm insane.
'Cause you know I love the players and you love the game.
'Cause we're young and we're reckless we'll take this way too far.
It'll leave you breathless or with a nasty scar.
But I've got a blank space, baby and I'll write your name cherry lips, crystal skies.
Stolen kisses, pretty lies you're the King, baby, I'm your Queen find out what you want.
Be that girl for a month.
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no.
Screaming, crying, perfect storms I can make all the tables turn.
Rose garden filled with thorns keep you second guessing like "Oh my God, who is she?".
I get drunk on jealousy but you'll come back each time you leave 'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream.
Boys only want love if it's torture.
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya (feat. Imogen Heap).
The drought was the very worst when the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst It was months, and months of back and forth.
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore.
Hung my head as I lost the war, and the sky turned black like a perfect storm rain came pouring down when I was drowning that's when I could finally breathe.
And by morning gone was any trace of you.
I think I am finally clean.
There was nothing left to do when the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room so I punched a hole in the roof.
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you the water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing.
And by morning, gone was any trace of you said I think I am finally clean.
10 months sober, I must admit just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it.
10 months older, I won't give in now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it.
Finally clean think I'm finally clean.
Oh oh oh.
Stand there like a ghost shaking from the rain (rain).
She'll open up the door and say, "Are you insane ('ane)?".
Say it's been a long 6 months.
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want.
And that's how it works.
That's how you get the girl.
And then you say "I want you for worse or for better I would wait forever and ever.
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together.
I would wait forever and ever." and that's how it works It's how you get the girl, girl...
Remind her how it used to be (yeah, yeah).
With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks (cheeks) tell her how you must have lost your mind. (uh-uh) when you left her all alone, and never told her why (why).
That's how you lost the girl.
And now you say.
I would wait forever and ever (ever and ever) broke your heart, I'll put it back together (together).
I would wait forever and ever (ever and ever)." It's how you get the girl, girl... (Yeah, yeah) and you could know (oh-oh oh oh).
That I don't want you to go oh-oh..
Remind me how it used to be.
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks.
And say you want me.
"I want you for worse or for better (for worse or for better).
I want you forever and ever." It's how you get the girl, girl.
That's how it works.
That's how you got the girl.
You stand with your hand on my waist line.
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight I can hear them whisper as we pass by.
It's a bad sign, bad sign something happens when everybody finds out see the vultures circling dark clouds.
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out.
It could burn out cause they got the cages, they got the boxes.
And guns they are the hunters, we are the foxes.
And we run baby, I know places we won't be found.
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down cause I, I know places we can hide I know places, I know places.
Lights flash and we'll run for the fences let them say what they want, we won't hear it loose lips sink ships all the damn time.
Not this time just grab my hand and don't ever drop it.
My love I know places.
They take their shots, but we're bulletproof.
And you know for me, it's always you.
In the dead of night, your eyes so green and I know for you, it's always me.
It's 2 AM in your car windows down, you pass my street, the memories start.
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead you're thinking that I hate you now 'Cause you still don't know what I never said.
I wish you would come back wish I never hung up the phone like I did.
And I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would.
It's 2 AM in my room.
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you.
We're a crooked love in a straight line down.
Makes you wanna run and hide then it makes you turn right back around.
I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.
I wish we could go back.
And remember what we were fighting for.
And I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish.
You always knew how to push my buttons you give me everything and nothing.
This mad mad love makes you come running to stand back where you stood.
I wish you would, I wish you would I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish...
2 AM, here we are see your face, hear my voice in the dark.
We're a crooked love in a straight line down but it made us turn right back around.
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did.
And I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore.
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish you would.
We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything we wait for trains that just aren't coming we show off our different scarlet letters.
Trust me, mine is better.
We're so young but we're on the road to ruin.
We play dumb but we know exactly what we're doing we cry tears of mascara in the bathroom.
Honey, life is just a classroom 'Cause, baby, I could build a castle.
Out of all the bricks they threw at me and every day is like a battle but every night with us is like a dream.
Baby, we're the new romantics come on, come along with me.
Heart break is the national anthem we sing it proudly.
We are too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet the best people in life are free.
We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding we hang back, it's all in the timing It's poker, he can't see it in my face.
But I'm about to play my Ace.
We need love, but all we want is danger.
We team up then switch sides like a record changer.
The rumors are terrible and cruel but, honey, most of them are true.
So come on, come along with me.
Please take my hand and.
Please take me dancing and.
Please leave me stranded It's so romantic looking at it now.
It all seems so simple.
We were lying on your couch I remember.
You took a Polaroid of us then discovered (then discovered) the rest of the world was black and white.
But we were in screaming color and I remember thinking are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet?
Last December (last December) we were built to fall apart.
Then fall back together (back together) your necklace hanging from my neck.
The night we couldn't quite forget when we decided (we decided).
To move the furniture so we could dance baby, like we stood a chance.
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying.
And I remember thinkin'.
(Are we out of the woods?!) remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in the hospital room when you started cryin', baby, I did, too.
But when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you.
Remember when we couldn't take the heat I walked out and said, "I'm settin' you free,".
But the monsters turned out to be just trees.
And when the sun came up, you were lookin' at me you were lookin' at me.
I remember, oh, I remember.
I stay out too late.
Got nothing in my brain.
That's what people say, mmm-mmm.
I go on too many dates but I can't make them stay at least that's what people say, mmm-mmm.
But I keep cruising can't stop, won't stop moving It's like I got this music.
In my mind saying, "It's gonna be alright." 'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play.
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake.
I shake it off, I shake it off heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break and the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.
I never miss a beat.
I'm lightning on my feet.
And that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own).
I make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go) and that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm.
That's what they don't know, mmm-mmm can't stop, won't stop grooving shake it off, I shake it off.
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off.
Hey, hey, hey.
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world you could've been getting down to this sick beat.
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend.
She's like "Oh, my god!" but I'm just gonna shake.
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair.
Won't you come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake yeah ohhh.
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (haters gonna hate) I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake.
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break (mmmm) and the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake (and fake, and fake, and fake) I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (you've got to).
You come and pick me up, no headlights a long drive.
Could end in burning flames or paradise.
Fade into view, oh, it's been a while since I have even heard from you (heard from you) I should just tell you to leave 'cause I.
Know exactly where it leads but I.
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye.
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like and when we go crashing down, we come back every time.
'Cause we never go out of style we never go out of style.
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt and I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt.
We never go out of style.
So it goes he can't keep his wild eyes on the road takes me home.
Lights are off, he's taking off his coat, hmm, yeah.
I say, "I heard, oh, that you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl.".
He says, "What you've heard is true but I.
Can't stop thinking about you," and I...
I said, "I've been there, too, a few times." 'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye and I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (tight little skirt).
Take me home.
Just take me home, yeah.
Just take me home (out of style) clear blue water, high tide came and brought you in.
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will skies grew darker, currents swept you out again.
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone In silent screams.
In wildest dreams.
I never dreamed of this.
This love is good, this love is bad this love is alive back from the dead.
These hands had to let it go free.
And this love came back to me tossing, turning, struggled through the night with someone new and I could go on and on, on and on.
Lantern burning, flickered in my mind for only you but you're still gone, gone, gone been losing grip.
On sinking ships you showed up just in time this love left a permanent mark.
This love is glowing in the dark this love, this love, this love, this love...
Your kiss, my cheek, I watched you leave your smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees.
When you're young you just run but you come back to what you need walking through a crowd.
The village is aglow kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats.
Everybody here.
Wanted something more searching for a sound we hadn't heard before.
And it said.
Welcome to New York It's been waiting for you.
It's a new soundtrack.
I could dance to this beat, beat forever more the lights are so bright.
But they never blind me, me when we first dropped our bags on.
Apartment floors.
Took our broken hearts.
Put them in a drawer everybody here was someone else and you can want who you want.
Boys and boys and.
Girls and girls welcome to New York (New York) like any great love it keeps you.
Like any real love It's ever changing.
Like any true love It drives you crazy but you know you wouldn't.
Change anything anything.
I could dance to this beat.
But they never blind me new soundtrack so bright.
They never blind me he said, "Let's get out of this town.
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds." I thought heaven can't help me now.
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down he's so tall and handsome as hell.
He's so bad but he does it so well.
I can see the end as it begins.
My one condition is.
Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress staring at the sunset, babe.
Red lips and rosy cheeks.
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your wildest dreams, ah-ha oh.
Wildest dreams, ah-ha oh.
I said, "No one has to know what we do." his hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room and his voice is a familiar sound.
Nothing lasts forever but this is getting good now.
And when we've had our very last kiss my last request is you see me in hindsight.
Tangled up with you all night burning it down someday when you leave me.
I bet these memories follow you around.
You'll see me in hindsight even if it's just pretend.
Even if it's just in your (just pretend, just pretend) In your wildest dreams, ah-ha oh.
(even if it's just in your wildest dreams) ah-ha.
In your wildest dreams, ah-ha.
Flashing lights and we took a wrong turn and we.
Fell down a rabbit hole.
You held on tight to me 'Cause nothing's as it seems I'm spinning out of control.
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
Didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me I should have slept with one eye open at night.
We found wonderland you and I got lost in it and we pretended it could last forever.
And life was never worse but never better.
Eh eh In wonderland.
So we went on our way too in love to think straight all alone or so it seemed.
But there were strangers watching and whispers turned to talking and talking turned to screams.
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?
It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind.
But darling, we found wonderland.
I reached for you but you were gone.
I knew I had to go back home you search the world for something else to make you feel like what we had.
And in the end in wonderland we both went mad.
And we pretended it could last forever (last forever) you and I got lost in it (got lost in it).
And life was never worse but never better (never better) you and I got lost in it (wonderland).
And we pretended it could last forever (in wonderland).
One look, dark room meant just for you.
Time moved too fast you play it back buttons on a coat.
Lighthearted joke no proof, not much but you saw enough.
Small talk, he drives coffee at midnight.
The light reflects.
The chain on your neck he says, "Look up.".
And your shoulders brush no proof, one touch.
But you felt enough you can hear it in the silence, silence you can feel it on the way home, way home.
You could see it with the lights out, lights out you are in love, true love.
You are in love morning, his place.
Burnt toast, Sunday.
You keep his shirt.
He keeps his word and for once you let go.
Of your fears and your ghosts.
One step, not much.
But it said enough you kiss on sidewalks you fight then you talk.
One night he wakes.
Strange look on his face pauses, then says.
"You're my best friend." and you knew what it was.
He is in love and so it goes.
You two are dancing in a snow globe 'round and 'round and he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown.
And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars and why I spent my whole life trying to put it into words.
'Cause you can hear it in the silence you can feel it on the way home.
You could see it with the lights out you're in love.
You can see it with the lights out, lights out the way you look, the way you laugh the way you love with all you have.
There ain't nothing bout you that don't do something for me once I thought that love was something I could never do.
Never knew that I could feel this much but this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you Is more than a reaction to your touch.
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough.
The way you kiss, The way you cry.
The way you move when you walk by there's ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you) that don't do something for me.
In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows.
That never knocked me off my feet.
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go and baby it's no mystery why I surrender girl you got everything.
There ain't nothing bout you (there ain't nothing bout you) I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on.
Your dance, your drive, You make me feel alive the way you talk, the way you tease.
By now I think you see that (with Zac Efron).
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run outrun my gun.
Faster than my bullet.
Ellen works a long day giving weird interviews in a slick, cool sweater.
And it gets kinda weird.
Yeah, calling us like we're boyfriend and girlfriend but it's not cause were just sitting here.
And we got cat videos and dance on Betty White and stuff.

Every single time I come on this show It's really weird really weird.
All because of Ellen.

Eight times now and I still remember.
Ellen hiding in the bathroom with a hidden camera and she scared me so bad and I fell and I could of died.
She's always asks me who I'm dating.
Every time I'm on this show and I don't even know why.
But it gets five million hits on youtube.
Cause, Every single time I come on this show.
I wake up, I stretch out.
I wonder what you're doing right now yeah, I slept in my makeup again tell myself I must be crazy.
Thinking about him.
I find myself something decent to wear.
Take the towel out of my hair.
About that time, you call me.
And I'm reminded, without you I'd be a stranger in an all night diner.
Waiting for her love to find her.
Lonely like a harbor line.
Thats never seen a boat just like a line in an old love letter no one wrote.
I go to work, work all day.
I'm a walking tape recorder of everything you say walk to my car, dig out my keys.
Start thinking if you were with anyone but me.
There you are, on the street standing there all waiting on me yeah, I show you, my new shoes.
You say you love em, and baby without you I'd be.
Wonder what you're doing right now american boy, living life as it goes.
Sittin' on the fence posts.
Living in the lie american boy, living in the real world.
Trying just to get the girl trying to survive the simple things in life are always new.
growing up on Sam Hill avenue.
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just the greatest living hero that ever was nothing in the world can ever once destroy.
the hope of an american boy living off of bar tips, trying for relationships.
looking for the love suddenly rise, an american beauty suddenly he cheats, sent from above.
the dream of an american boy.
American boy, raising little babies hearing daddy maybe, I'll be like you.
Suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn that's grown up, american boy.
growing up on Grandview avenue nothing in the world will ever once destroy.
No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy.
Well, she was an American girl raised on promises she couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life.
Somewhere else.
After all it was a great big world.
With lots of places to run to and if she had to die trying.
She had one little promise she was gonna keep oh yeah, all right.
Take it easy baby make it last all night she was an American girl.
Well, it was kind of cold that night she stood alone on her balcony she could see the cars roll by.
Out on 441.
Like waves crashing on the beach.
And for one desperate moment there he crept back in her memory.
God, it's so painful.
It's something that's so close but still so far out of reach oh, take it easy now sometimes I wonder how it's gonna feel.
Will my first love be true and real?
Will I be ready when my heart starts to fall?
What will I do when my love comes to call?
And my daddy tells me that I light up his world.
Everyday he says, darling you're my best girl.
He tried to teach me from the very start.
The meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart.
Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain.
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love.
I know I'm not a little girl anymore cause I'm feeling things I've never felt before sweet sensations and anticipations.
Calling commotion to my emotions.
And I hear the words my daddy said to me he said be true 2 yourself & keep your spirit free.
And love will find you one way or another be good to yourself and be good to each other.
It's a run around the world and it's moving so fast.
Though I wanna find.
A love that's gonna last.
A love so strong that I can withstand the weight of the world.
In the palm of its hand am I ready for the boy, am I ready for this game am I ready for the kiss, am I ready for the stars.
Am I ready for the bliss, am I ready for love.
Angelinas got a pretty face.
And really long brown hair.
Lives somewhere in some wide open space.
Ive never been there I guess some people come around and purpose she.
But I dont cause I have always been a bit reckless.
And I am not your typical princess Im fine just a bit of a mess.
And Im not perfect you could say I wasnt brought up that way.
Just watched Stephen run across the field watched him catch the ball.
Hes got everything youd wanna be hes funny, dark and tall watch him run across to Angelina.
But I wont cause stardom pushed across the line.
Tripped over my two feet hey oh yeah but aint it funny how It all comes out.
Isnt life sweet?
And Im not, Im not oh (originally by Vonda Shepard) I like the way you wanted me.
Every night for so long, baby.
I like the way you needed me every time the things got rocky, yeah.
I was believing in you was I mistaken?
Do you mean do you mean what you say?
When you say our love could last forever well, I'd rather you be mean.
Than love and lie I'd rather hear the truth.
Than have to say goodbye.
I'd rather take a blow at least then I would know but baby don't you break my heart slow.
I like the way you'd hold me I like the way you'd sing to me do you say.
Do you say what you mean?
Oh, yeah, yeah you'd run around and lead me on forever.
While I stay at home.
Still thinking we're together I want our love to last forever.
But I'd rather you be mean and I'd rather take a blow.
Now baby don't you break my heart.
I'm so glad you made time to see me how's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while your guard is up, and I know why.
Is still burned in the back of your mind.
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night.
And I go back to December all the time.
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine I go back to December, turn around and make it alright.
I go back to December all the time these days, I haven't been sleeping staying up, playing back myself leaving.
When your birthday passed, and I didn't call then I think about summer, all the beautiful times I watched you laughing from the passenger side.
And realized I loved you in the fall.
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind you gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye.
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile the first time you ever saw me cry.
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't so if the chain is on your door, I understand.
And then he said it's too late to apologize.
It's too late.
He said it's too late to apologize.
And I said, this is me swallowing my pride (It's too late to apologize) he said you're not sorry.
No, no, no you're not sorry.
(feat. Kendrick Lamar) 'Cause baby, now we got bad blood.
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
Hey! I can't take it back, look where I'm at!
We was on D like DOC, remember that? (Remember that) my TLC was quite OD, ID my facts (ID my).
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq I don't hate you but I hate to critique, overrate you.
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you.
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more no I don't fear no more, better yet respect ain't quite sincere no more.
Oh, it's so sad to.
Think about the good times.
You and I.
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
And I don't think we can solve 'em and baby, now we got bad blood, hey!
Hey! Remember when you tried to write me off?
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need yah follow procedure, remember? Oh wait you got amnesia?
It was my season for battle wounds, battle scars body bumped, bruised stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through.
Still, all my life, I got money and power and you gotta live with the bad blood now If you live like that, you live with ghosts.
(You forgive, you forget but you never let it go) If you live like that you live with ghosts.
(Think we can solve 'em!) (Look what you've done).
Now we've got problems your beautiful eyes.
Stare right into my eyes and sometimes I think of you late at night I don't know why.
i want to be somewhere where you are I want to be where...
You're here, You're eyes are looking into mine so baby, make me fly my heart has never felt this way before.
I'm looking through your I'm looking through your eyes.
I wake up, I'm alive In only a little while... I'll cry cause you're my lullaby.
SO baby come hold me tight cause I-I I want to be everything you need.
Just as long as you're mine I'll be your everything tonight.
Let me love you, kiss you.
Oh baby let me miss you let me see your.
Dream about.
Dream about your eyes eyes, Eyes...Beautiful eyes.
All is quiet in the world tonight catching stars and fireflies the summer sings a lullaby.
With just me and my baby on the hood of his daddy's car.
Pass around his old guitar bet mama's wondering where we are.
It's just me and my baby the world is spinning round cause look just what I've found.
Ooh, life's so sweet right here ooh, keeping it young and crazy ooh, just wanna stay right here.
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby driving home by the river side.
Wishing I could slow down time taking pictures in my mind.
Both me and my baby.
The car pulls up and I'm home too late.
We didn't take that interstate back roads was a better way for me and my baby.
The closer that we get oh, I can't leave yet look at what we've found.
So turn that car around.
Ooh, hanging with my baby hanging with my baby, my baby.
I live down the street in a broken down house and a car up on blocks in the driveway.
The moment we meet, there was never a doubt that we won't forget this Sunday.
It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles.
And it all leads to this - our first kiss.
All my friends are saying.
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off you're better off without him.
Find yourself another girl, that boy is trouble you're better off, you're better off.
They can talk forever, they just don't know better.
We drive around town in a rusty old truck somehow it feels like we're flying don't wanna come down.
But they make it so tough.
'Cause everyone we know is trying to push us apart hide it down in our hearts and they get what they want cause you're gone.
Girl, why are you crying?
You're better off, you're better off without him.
You come to my door.
In the pouring rain.
We know what we don't have to say.
You hand me a rose and a note that says we don't have to do things their way.
Well, they can talk forever, they just don't know better her hair is Harlow gold, her lips sweet surprise her hands are never cold, she's got Bette Davis eyes.
She'll turn the music on you, you won't have to think twice she's pure as New York snow, she got Bette Davis eyes and she'll tease you, she'll unease you.
All the better just to please you she's precocious and she knows just what it takes to make a pro blush.
She got Greta Garbo standoff sighs, she's got Bette Davis eyes she'll let you take her home, it whets her appetite.
She'll lay you on the throne, she got Bette Davis eyes.
She'll take a tumble on you, roll you like you were dice until you come up blue, she's got Bette Davis eyes.
She'll expose you, when she snows you hope you'll feed with the crumbs she throws you she's ferocious.
All the boys think she's a spy, she's got Bette Davis eyes.
She'll tease you, she'll unease you just to please you, she's got Bette Davis eyes she'll expose you when she snows you.
She knows you, she's got Bette Davis Eyes here you are now.
Fresh from your war back from the edge of time and all that you were.
Stripped to the bone I thought you'd want to know.
That when you feel the world is crashing all around your feet.
Come running headlong into my arms I'll never judge you.
I can only love you.
Come now running headlong.
Into my arms.
Lay down your guns too weak to run.
Nothing can harm you here your precious heart.
Broken and scarred somehow you made it through.
I only ask that you won't go again when you feel the world is crashing.
I'm so glad to see you smiling so good to hear your laugh I think that you've found you even.
Missed yourself I'm only asking this because I think that.
Truth be told oh, you'll never go again.
Emily comes home from school.
Grabs onto her daddy's hand he says, "Baby girl, what's wrong with you?" she says, "Please, don't make me go back there again.".
She said, "I wish there was some way to make them stop it." so he drives down to.
That principles office and says "I didn't bring her up so they could cut her down.
I didn't bring her here so they could shut her out.
I live my whole damn life.
To see that little girl's smile.
So why are tears pouring down that sweet face?
She wasn't brought up that way." emily's home late again.
He sees that boy drive away oh, but something's different this time she doesn't have too much to say.
She said, "He tried but there's just some things I won't do.".
And through the tears she said, "I couldn't do that to you." and he said "I didn't bring you up.
So he could wear you down.
Take that innocent heart.
And turn it inside out.
To see my little girl's smile.
So don't let nobody take that away.
You weren't brought up that way." the phone rings on a rainy night.
Says, "It's officer Tate." he said, "Sir, there's been an accident.
You better come down here right away.
A drunken driver missed an over pass.
And Emily  she's fading fast.".
He says, "God, I didn't bring her up to watch them lay her down.
Nearly killed me the day they put her momma in the ground.
Only thing that kept me alive.
Was that little girl's smile.
So please don't take that away.
It won't be easy taking her today.
He stands over the hospital bed.
Emily opens her eyes.
I had to catch my breath when I saw you there across the room.
Holding her hand I'd have never guessed.
That starting over would look so good on you.
But here I am still believing there might come a day.
We'll pick up where we left off and by the way.
Your eyes are dancing I'd say the chances of that are getting slim by the way.
My heart's still breaking It's gonna take it a while to love again so many things that I forgot to say.
I should've let you know all the ways you made me feel alive.
I guess it's too late so I'll just get my coat.
And make my way into this breezy night give you one last wave maybe you'll drop what you're doing.
And come over here to say I'm looking good but by the way.
You still look amazing and I must've been crazy to let you get away If you ever wondered.
Still got the same old number; just in case.
I still miss you.
And i still love you by the way, oh any day now, they're talking war.
I can see the look that's in your eyes they're not talking a week or two.
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
You pack a suitcase, take a picture from the wall I always knew this time would come when I ask how long you think you're gonna be.
You say, this crazy world's come undone summer's over and leaves begin to fall.
And another winter's on the way I knew I wasn't gonna take this very well.
But I'd give anything to have you here today.
Everyday now they're talking war.
& I know this time is like it's never been before we're not talking about a week or two.
I drive around this town In a Mustang with the top down.
And six running horses under my hood.
Well thats good enough for me.
Dont need the real thing thats just another thing.
For me to try to tame dont know if I could It might just break me.
I thought there for a little while every sunset Id be a riding off with him.
Snap buttons on a denim shirt.
Blue jeans and a little dirt thats the closest youll see me.
Feet hanging out a pickup truck crazy and a little rough.
Running free thats the closest to a cowboy.
Youll see me.
Before I met him I was so sane and grounded before he taught me how to lie.
And crawl out the window I learned the dirt roads and I got my heart broken.
Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry and how to let go It was all a little.
Wonderful and strange but Ill never look.
At a sunset the same night sitting fishing by the river bank.
Swimming in the water tank I'd never gone with the wind just let it flow.
Let it take me where it wants to go 'Til you open the door there's so much more.
I'd never seen it before I was trying to fly.
But I couldn't find wings.
But you came along and you changed everything you lift my feet off the ground you spin me around.
You make me crazier, crazier feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes you make me crazier, crazier, crazier.
I've watched from a distance as you made life your own every sky was your own kind of blue and I wanted to know how that would feel.
And you made it so real you showed me something that I couldn't see you opened my eyes.
And you made me believe.
Baby you showed me what living is for I don't wanna hide anymore oh oh.
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes.
Crazier, crazier.
Ive been counting days and Ive been being patient.
About a little thing called love crossing all my fingers.
Letting my heart linger.
Trying to get some help from up above I dont want to jinx my luck Ive left it all behind me.
And Ive been hoping every day that someday you will find me.
So I cross my heart and hope for you knock on wood and rope the moon.
Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right and I wait around that old wishing well you never know if time will tell.
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight dreaming of you baby Ive been thinking maybe.
There is something I can do.
Cause Ive been on the verge of.
Running around in circles.
Baby all I want is you.
Do you believe in miracles.
Please tell me if youve seen one.
Id like to know just where to go because I think I need one.
He said, "I got me a nice new apartment.
In a city, wouldn't you have hated that?
I'm getting by with a broken heart you left me with." he hangs up the phone and she whispers back.
Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow In dark blue Tennessee he was lying when he said he moved to L.A.
He's just hiding out on the other side of town with his head in his hands and she's just 7 miles away.
He's staring out the window and puts her picture down saying she almost called him on the night that he wrote.
These simple words on his goodbye note.
She walks to school with her arms crossed It's just another day.
At 10 o'clock she hears this screaming then finally she sees them.
It's scary how things change and I saw the story on the news.
I saw the footage from the roof I sat down and cried didn't she call you?
Didn't she need you bad enough?
Was there some reason I'm not aware of?
Did you not write it down just one more thing to do.
Where were you and didn't she pray too.
He kissed his wife good bye.
And took the earliest flight so he could be home that night.
To put his kids to sleep down the aisle three men walked and said "We're here to die for our God.".
He stood up and said, "That's funny 'Cause my God died for me." I put the magazine down.
I read his words out loud didn't he call you?
Didn't he need you bad enough?
Did you not write it down?
Where were you?
And didn't he pray too?
The taxis pulled up on the very day of they rode 100 floors up just to come back down they never thought they'd see the day.
That the towers up in flames there was nothing left to say when it all came down.
And didn't they call you?
Didn't they need you bad enough?
Where were you? Where were you?
And didn't they pray too?
I walk to school and I wear a cross I'm counting every day.
My momma stood across the room.
Face to face but never eye to eye recalling words we said the battle that we swore.
We'd never fight breaking pieces off with every lie.
A tear came to her eye and she said don't walk away now.
And don't rip my heart out don't you block me out tonight honey where are you?
And don't hate me for loving you he walked around my life and made blind.
With every single move he caught me staring at him.
Mad about him.
Little that I knew.
Love is different when you play the fool and all I wanna do is say.
Don't you make cry tonight like you always do.
I slammed the door sat on the floor.
Cried into my bed said are you there?
Do you even care?
To cross above my head but someone said.
Don't turn away now things are meant to happen like this.
I know it's right for you I looked up at the sky face to face and finally.
Eye to eye.
Here in my mind the sky looks the same on every day you loved me when we started home it started to rain.
You put your coat around me we stood there in the road.
You held me so close but did you ever let go.
Down came the rain.
Lightning and thunder we tried in vain to hold on to each other.
Winds of change blew you away from me.
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin.
The bitter sting of what we couldve been just when our love was like a burning flame.
In through the window I see her with you.
Im soaked to the skin, youre warm and dry I guess the storm is over for you but look at the tears here in my eyes.
I just stood there like a ghost as you held her so close.
And as I let you go.
Love like this changes who you are every kiss you gave me is a scar all I need is to move on fast.
But all I want is to have you back and it just keeps falling.
(originally by Train) you know you guys have a lot of amazing bands from this part of the world, did you know that?
Well now he's back in the atmosphere.
With Drops of Jupiter in his hair, hey, hey.
He walks like summer and talks like rain reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey since his return from the stay on the moon.
He listens like spring and he talks like June, hey, hey tell me did you sail across the sun did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded.
That heaven is overrated tell me, did you fall for a shooting star.
One without a permanent scar and did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there.
Well now he's back from that soul vacation.
Chasing his way through the constellation, hey, hey he checks out Mozart while he does tae-bo reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey.
I'm afraid that he might think of me as plain ol' Jane.
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land.
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet did you finally get the chance to dance along in the light of day.
Head back to the Milky Way and tell me, did Venus blow your mind.
Was it everything you wanted to find can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken.
Your best friend always sticking up for you, even when I know you're wrong can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone conversation.
The best soy latte that you ever had. . .and me.
Tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet head back toward the Milky Way.
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself?
Na na na na na na na na na na na na naaa, oh oh ohhh your best friend always sticking up for you, even when I know you're wrong.
Everybody's waiting everybody's watching.
Even when you're sleeping keep your ey-eyes open the tricky thing.
Is yesterday we were just children.
Playing soldiers just pretending dreaming dreams with happy endings.
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords but now we've stepped into a cruel world where everybody stands and keeps score.
Keep your eyes open everybody's waiting for you to break down everybody's watching to see the fallout.
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping so here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard.
Every lesson forms a new scar.
They never thought you'd make it this far but turn around (turn around), oh they've surrounded you It's a showdown (showdown) and nobody comes to save you now.
But you've got something they don't.
Yeah you've got something they don't you've just gotta keep your eyes open keep your ey-eyes.
Keep your feet ready.
Heartbeat steady.
Keep your aim locked.
The night goes dark (Keep your eyes open ) Isn't it funny how many times we can say.
We drawn the line, cross it out, turn the page and moved on that's what we thought.
But here I am in the same old car having myself another same old brown-eyed bar.
Uh oh, uh oh I won't tell nobody I won't tell my friends.
We'll just drive down this road till the one we're on ends and we'll tell each other things like I need you you and me.
Baby this is what we do.
I may see there are people you just come back to so fall back on me.
Fall back on you you always let someone come in between your talking round the truth and never say what we mean.
Look at all this wasted time I won't tell my friend we'll just drive down this road and pray it doesn't end.
And we'll tell each other things, like I love you there are people who you come back to.
Maybe we'll last maybe we won't.
Maybe we'll stop talking and I'll haunt you like a ghost but just, baby, get along with me.
There are people that you come back too.
Fall back on me baby I'll fall back on you.
Fall back on me baby.
Someone struck a match against the night all I could see was you and I.
I was captivated.
A perfect little dream inside my head and then reality crept in, and erased it.
For a while I thought that I could hold you but you were just a temporary high.
Firefly you drew me to you.
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky and you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you, firefly something so beautiful and free was as never meant to be caged in.
I thought I had you in my hand I tried to catch you, but I can't chase the wind.
And just as I reach out to touch you I remind myself you were meant to fly.
I wish I could keep you firefly.
I like to think I'd be all that you wanted.
Not even that is enough and you don't know it do you?
I wish I could keep you I wish I could keep you,  firefly.
My name's Gracie.
I'll be five in May kinda scared 'cause I never been on a plane.
My mama says that it'll be alright 'Cause I'm gunna see my daddy tonight and she says that.
There's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven.
An' I don't wanna get there too soon and I know there's a God because I met him and I see it when I'm looking at you.
There ain't no accidents in what we do my name's Heather guess we're on the same flight.
Don't mind Gracie she could talk to you all night she's finally well enough to travel.
doctor says she's in the clear she's been in and out of hospital.
Since the beginning of the year and there's a whole a lot of good people in Heaven but none of us want to get there too soon.
James T. Johnson that's her daddy's name he's been overseas.
It'll be a year today.
He never talked about being scared over the phone he just said me and Gracie will come and take him on and I don't wanna get there too soon.
And the people that we meet as we go through the rain there are no accidents in what we do.
Guess mine is not the first heart broken my eyes are not the first to cry I'm not the first to know.
There's just no getting over you you know I'm just a fool who's willing.
To sit around and wait for you but, baby, can't you see there's nothing else for me to do?
I'm hopelessly devoted to you but now there's nowhere to hide.
Since you pushed my love aside I'm out of my head.
Hopelessly devoted to you.
My head is saying, "Fool, forget him." my heart is saying, "Don't let go.
Hold on till the end.".
And that's what I intend to do I dont think that passenger seat.
Has ever looked this good to me he tells me about his night.
And I count the colors in his eyes hell never fall in love he swears.
As he runs his fingers through his hair Im laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong.
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind.
He tells a joke, I fake a smile.
But I know all his favorite songs I could tell you his favorite color's green he loves to argue, born on the seventeenth.
His sister's beautiful, he has his fathers eyes.
And if you asked me if I love him Id lie he looks around the room.
Innocently overlooks the truth shouldnt a light go on?
Doesnt he know that Ive had him memorized for so long?
He sees everything black and white.
Never let nobody see him cry.
I dont let nobody see me wishing he was mine he stands there, then walks away.
My god if I could only say "Im holding every breath for you..." hed never tell you but he can play guitar.
I think he can see through everything but my heart first thought when I wake up Is "My god, hes beautiful.".
So I put on my make-up and pray for a miracle.
Yes, I could tell you his favorite color's green he loves to argue, oh, and it kills me If you asked me if I love him.
Wish I had concentrated they said love was complicated but it's something i just fell into.
And it was over-rated but just look what i've created I came out alive but i'm black and blue-ue.
Before you ask me if i'm alright think about what i.
Had to do-oo, yeah wake up and smell the break-up fix my heart, put on my make-up.
Another mess i didn't plan and i'll bet, you thought you'd beat me.
Wish you could only see I've got an i heart question mark written on the back of my hand.
I'd be fine if you just walked by but you had to talk about why.
You were wrong and i was right but i can't believe you made me sit at home and cry like a baby.
Wait right by the phone every night and now you ask about you and i.
There's no you and i remember what you put me through.
I had to.
Fix my heart put on my make-up I wish you'd could only see I got an i heart question mark.
Written on the back of my hand and when you're home alone at night you'll still wonder.
Why you took everything i had, oh baby I had a lot about you and i.
And i know someday you will...
Realize that we won't make-up It didn't go the way you planed and you'll know you didn't beat me.
When you look down and see an i heart question mark, yeah.
(feat. Sammy Adams).

Double platinum wherever she go south of France to Reno met her out in Vegas.

Red lips so hard to miss.
What's wrong with being promiscuous and I can teach you bad, bad things.
If you into it don't need to get intimate...just yet slow down, I know that.
You thinking you and me...just met but girl, I got the remedy most important in chemistry.
Good girl gone bad too much for a Kennedy some say, some say, they sell they souls for a couple hits I'd rather live a life of gold with a perfect chick.
Cause that one moment when your breathless and your hoping and ya feel the same way, same way.
Sparks blowing off that cute face and that shy smile...oh man I haven't crushed this hard in quite a while...oh damn and I can care less that your famous.
We can make the perfect couple cause my first name big, last name trouble.
That you never loved me, or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah.
I like my music loud I like my windows down.
So I can scream I like my trucks a little bigger than the rest.
So I can see dont try me.
Dont fight me you be you and Ill be me.
They say Ive always known what I wanted my friends and enemies.
Will tell you its true you will find out I always get it.
I know what I want.
And it aint you your mum and daddys walls are covered up in pictures of you.
You never met a mirror.
That you didn't look again into so sorry, dont worry.
Im sure there are so many girls.
Who love you like you do and it aint you oh oh baby, dont persuade me.
I know that you aint used to no.
So let me say it real slow what I wanted, its true.
I get what I want and they say Ive always known and youll will find out.
I... I used to fly.
Didn't matter where I'd been 'Cause I'd seen the sky I wanna tell you why.
But somehow I know I would break down and cry I know you can't see me here.
But I am not alone.
I'm lying here in invisible arms and I won't be alone tonight.
You... you know I would die.
Before I let them see me see me cry please don't leave tonight.
Oh let me down slowly show me a light oh let me think I'm strong.
Please don't bring me down I need you tonight oh baby give me one more chance.
(I'll show you that I love you) I want you please let me.
Back in your heart oh darling I was blind to let you go.
(Let you go baby) now that I see you in her arms.
I want you back I want you back, ohh baby.
Throwing pennies at the fountain when you're standing on a mountain.
It's kinda hard to aim.
But like the trees we cut our names in there must be an explanation.
Guess it didn't given off rain.
I need reasons why you're leaving well I guess I wished on a plane I thought was a star.
I guess what you wrote on a paper.
Wasn't really from your heart could've sworn you said you loved me.
I guess heard you wrong.
And I guess I wished on a plane and I thought was a star.
Diving off into the deep end honestly believe you'd be there when I jumped in.
Is ain't your territory we had the perfect love story.
except ending.
Nothing comes true when it comes to you.
And I thought it was a star.
And I was too cloudy.
It's not my fault I just couldn't see.
I thought it was a star wasn't really in your heart.
She didn't have a reason to go, oh no she didn't have a reason to stay.
Either way she didn't tell anyone about her first ray of sun.
She looked at her keys and found a reason to run and time stands still when you're nowhere bound.
But I understand it somehow If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies and unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by, just south of knowing why I didn't really know her that well.
But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind.
She felt so out of touch, cos she just felt too much.
If you don't know what you want nothing's ever enough that's where I'm headed right now.
I don't have a plan, I don't have a map I don't even know if I'm ever going back.
I don't have a when and I don't have a where.
I don't even know if I'll know when I'm there but If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
I just drive on by I just drive on by, drive on, drive on drive all night.
If I drive on, drive on, drive on.
Drive all night, just south of knowing why.
I got a lying smile I never put out for you.
Cause I guess I never felt like I really needed to and they say little girls have big dreams and nothing in the world was gonna come between me and you.
And it was a long time coming I waited half my life just to find someone like you.
I spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out not knowing it'd be a long time going they say it's better to have lost than never to have loved at all.
And I say, whoever said that didn't have too far to fall and they say little girls are so naive that wasn't how it was supposed to be with me and you.
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out not knowing it will be a long time going I've burned my bridges, had sleepless nights.
Washed my sins on the neon lights.
And I'm still not over you a long time going and it will be a long time, long time going.
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh It will be a long time, long time going, going.
Come on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went out.
Sorry for the inconvenience, I didn't mean to let you down we were supposed to be forever but it's too bad you didn't see that to me.
You were the perfect view of misery I never talked about the tears I cried.
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights I never talked about the days he called.
There was something wrong, it was all my fault I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now.
But in case you haven't heard the news there wasn't much love to lose.
Let's talk about that golden boy that I met on a winter night how was I supposed to know that he was just as cold inside he smiled and I smiled, well the camera's in your mind.
And I lied, I swore that everything was fine I never talked about the nights he called I know you wanna talk about me.
How I gave up on love so foolishly but keep in mind there's a little girl in this little town.
With a little too much heart to go around.
Live forever, never say never.
You could do better, that's what she says.
Mama named her lucky on a starlit night.
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite.
Of the fact that she's different.
And yet she's the same.
And she says lucky you, lucky you.
She sings her little song, she walks along a little pathway headed for the skies.
Left to travels, lives they unravel.
Mind over matter, that's what she says and she says lucky you, lucky you, lucky you.
Maybe she'll sing you do do do do maybe she'll bring you into the skies honey she'll love you, funny how some view.
Angels above you ain't so far away your feet under the table I love it when they're touching mine.
Your hands make the crisps at the cradle.
To tell me everything is fine all I see is you looking at me.
Do you know when you go you make the sweetest sight at the window If you had never come out of the blue.
I would have stayed up and Made Up You you smile just like a picture It doesn't even need a frame.
Sometimes I wait to answer just to hear you say my name.
And all I want is just what I've got I'd never let you go even If I could.
Cause I never could've dreamed you up this good.
Made Up You.
I need you more than I know how to mention.
And I'd give forever to get your attention.
Be you're summer midnight with starry blue eyes.
That only see you and are yours every night ooh, ooh, love's like this It's something I missed.
And that small town daydream lasted all night.
Cussing out all those bright city lights.
Just look at you look at me heaven looked down to see.
We're falling now.
And there's nothing we ain't too sure of just two kids making up for lost love.
All of the days that I couldn't get it right It all disappeared lying here by your side with your dirty blue jeans and my crooked smile.
You make it look easy changing my life.
Small town daydream heaven had quite the time to figure this life out.
But baby I've got mine to give you everything you dream about.
And it's something I don't miss anymore he's got a nice little life.
He's gonna live it, but on friday nights he plays that mandolin.
Painted red, and he said It's not the best I know.
But it's mine, I'm gonna make it mine.
People there can't help but care about the friendly music of a guy who's getting by from their applause.
He's got a song that moves along he's got his local crowd tonight at Angelina's family bar and grill.
He's got his heart on his sleeve the songs he plays just living free.
But who knows what goes through his mind.
When he plays a song it brings along.
Everybody saying who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin oh yeah, mandolin.
Got a car, got a scar like everyone he's got a few but.
Everybody loves that mandolin got his problems, bills to pay.
Somehow that boy finds a way through paychecks in tip jars, yeah.
Oh he's the kind of guy.
Who never really wanted fame his feet are planted firmly on the ground he never wanted people to remember his name.
He never wanted word to get around.
That he found heaven on earth who's that guy who plays the mandolin oh, I'm the guy who plays the mandolin.
Oh, mandolin.
I shined your shoes I poured the wine I gave you all of my time.
I patched your dance smile.
That your friends which apparently is a crime.
I gave you space.
You took my place and gave it to her but life's too long.
To waste it all loving a liar.
And when love hands me matches now I'm gonna burn it down I keyed her car.
Got my guitar and wrote this damn song look what you've found.
She's been around I hear the lines long.
And don't you tell me.
To be nice I'm not a nice girl she died from complications.
Of the things you told her so when love hands me matches now.
Ain't it funny.
You said honey you meant sitting duck well i say cheater, liar, truck on fire, loser, leaver, deceiver.
Just a few I've thought of.
'Gonna burn it down.
Gonna burn it, burn it, burn it down.
Matches, now me and Britney used to sit on the front porch drinking lemonade talking about things no one else was ever supposed to hear.
In the summer shade she said she was gonna be a movie star and I said she was crazy.
Catching dreams and fireflies in a jar.
Just me and Britney we were babies, we were beautiful and free there was nothing that was out of reach.
For me and Britney she never made it to Hollywood but she made it to Memphis.
And this little old town just hasnt been the same since that boy she went ran off with, well I thought he was crazy.
Maybe I was just jealous that he'd come between me and Britney she was in love, she was beautiful and free.
She was always so much braver than me when the phone rang in the middle of the night before she said a word I knew it was her.
She said Im sorry for waking you up but I didnt know who else to call.
Or where else to go me and Britney sat down on the front porch talking about love and how it changes things.
Changes people and it changes names and everything but me and Britney were not as young, but were still beautiful and free.
Even when were old, were still gonna be me and Britney sitting on the front porch drinking lemonade.
Talking about things no one else was ever gonna hear in the summer shade.
I like glitter and sparkly dresses.
But I'm not gonna talk about that In my monologue.
I like baking and things that smell like winter.
La la la, la la la I like writing songs about douche bags who cheat on me but I'm not gonna say that.
I like writing their names into songs so they're ashamed to go in public la la, la la la la la.
This is my musical monologue you might think I'd bring up Joe the guy who broke up with me on the phone.
But I'm not gonna mention him.
Hey Joe! I'm doing real well.
Tonight I'm hosting SNL but I'm not gonna brag about that la la la, ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha, ha ha ha and if you're wondering if I might be dating the werewolf from Twilight.
(Hi Taylor!) I'm not gonna comment on that.
You might be expecting me to say something bad about Kanye and how he ran up on the stage.
And ruined my VMA monologue.....
But there's nothing more to say cause everything's okay I've got security lining this stage.
This is my SNL monologue.
That was my SNL monologue I know we've got a lot to say between now and forever.
But I'd be a game if you would play and my dear you get better.
All throughout the day you smile and walk away all I can think to do.
Is follow you.
If you leave I'll be crawling back for more.
if you need love I'll be standing at your door I'll be sick inside if baby you'd be my cure wherever you think I am tonight.
just know we're miles from a heartbreak because in the blink of a pretty brown eye I'll be right where you are baby.
sometime along the way you take my breath away distracted by he view.
I fall right into you and if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more and if you ever need love I'll be standing at your door.
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure they say I need to see all the people out there waiting but you take one look at me.
and I know the mistake I'd be making cuz if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more and if you ever need love I'm standing at your door.
I'll be sick inside if baby you be my cure.
I know we've got a lot to say between now and forever something about me didn't fit into your perfect world.
I bet the bluegrass stained your smile you should use a darker color when you write on the wall.
I haven't read it a thousand times.
Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize honey I was trying so hard to talk, walk, think, stop.
Anytime you want me to bend all my rules.
I used to let you choose.
Who you wanted me to be this time I'm flying free It's my turn to be me.
You liked the face but you had to replace me Inside I saw the walls of me go down you can take the girl away from.
Cowboy hats and steel guitars she'll still sing the same old songs.
Turned on that radio hey that's when I realized.
It wasn't our song, it was yours.
And in conversation baby I was decoration now I deserve a little bit more than (originally by David Mead).
On a crowded highway through a night alone I was barely breathing.
I was crawling home well, it's quite not London or the south of France.
Or an Asian Island or a second chance.
Going back to Nashville thinking 'bout the whole thing.
Guess you gotta run sometimes.
Maybe I'm a fast train blowin' through a valley watching all my life go by.
You're a distant memory you're an exit sign.
I was talking crazy.
On the drivers side.
And I know I hurt you.
But I can't confess.
Was that blood or a wine stain on your wedding dress.
Blowing through a mountain.
Laughing at a bad break.
What's the use of wondering why?
Maybe I'm a storm front blowing through a valley tearing up a good July.
And its safe and warm where nothing ever happens.
Could it be so hard.
To realign a star or two change a southern night for you thinking bout the whole thing.
Blowing though a valley I'm going back to Nashville blowing through the valley.
Going back to Naaaaahh....
I need you now read letters that I wrote on the wall.
And the message that I left when I called words I said drowned out by the rain waiting there for you but you never came.
My worlds a little colder now but Im keeping warm somehow so here you are at my window.
Guess nobody told you.
I dont need dont need you.
And I waited so frustrated.
Whos gonna hold you I dont need you dont need you now words I heard you whisper to me.
We were walking down a one-way street.
You need me now thats what youve been telling my friends.
That Ive come too far to go back there again my heart my mind and number have changed.
You might as well forget my name I dont need you dont need you.
Red letters that I wrote on the wall.
So whos gonna hold you.
I dont need you now and I dont know where you are.
I dont wonder where you are.
I dont dream about you cause I dont need you now I dont dream about the way that I never heard you say.
I need you I need you dont need you dont need you now.
Look at you look at me.
Look at who we could be.
I wanna know who you are.
What you want from the stars and every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing.
My head starts to spin and it hits me then I love you and every time you look at me I could go crazy but I don't.
Say it but I won't 'Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you.
And all I really wanna do is be next to you but I'm too tired to fight and I could tell you now.
But baby, never mind.
All the time there's nothing I can do, baby, to make it go away so look at you.
And look at me.
And think of who we could be.
But every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing all I really wanna say is I need you, babe.
But how could you understand?
What happens if you turn away and everything turns blue and grey?
And I just wish I told you never mind and I could tell you now, but baby, never mind yeah, oh yeah.
I could tell you now but never mind.
Yeah, oh yeah yeah and I could tell you now but never mind.
I think you fell off of your cloud today you didn't see it coming or did you.
You tried to please everybody but the sweet breeze swept you away the sun goes down on a good day.
Tomorrow is still an unknown you think you're all alone in this place I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby.
Oh don't fade away baby.
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do don't count the days as they leave you count them as you find a day new.
Don't fade away never fade hard to breathe, nobody knows it's you.
Somebody blows your candle out you wore a mask, now that's broken too everybody else was everything to you.
You think everybody wants a fight I think you fell out of the sky today.
I think you know it's true.
You've seen the world, now all you see is me.
Tell me now baby what are you gonna do It wasn't just like a movie the rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin.
I'm driving away and I, I guess you could say.
This is the last time I'll drive this way again.
When there's nothing to say and I try to grab at the fray cause I, I still love you but I can't bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side.
Bye, bye, baby I want you back but it's coming down to nothing and all you have is to walk away.
From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah.
The picture frame is empty.
It's black and white, you're smiling down at me I take your photo off the dash and back to the conversation.
I was so sure of everything we thought we'd always have.
I'm lost in the sound of it.
But here in the now comes in.
Seems like I'm becoming part of your past from the one thing I thought would never leave me and there's so much that I can't touch.
You're all I want but it's not enough this time and I can feel you like your slipping through my hands.
And I'm so scared of how this ends from the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah, yeah there was one thing I knew would never leave me.
Standing on the border looking out into the great unknown.
I can feel my heart beating faster as I step out on my own there's a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind I'm heading out tonight, traveling light.
I'm gonna start all over again.
And buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train see how far I can go cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain.
And talk to someone I don't know I will face the world around me.
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go and I will fall in love again because I can.
Gonna climb the mountain.
And look the eagle in the eye I won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly how could I have ever believed.
That love had to be so blind when freedom was waiting, down at the station.
All I had to do was make up my mind well, I have walked through the fire.
And crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt then the truth came shining like a light on me and now I can see my way out.
Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train I'm gonna have my breakfast with some pink champagne.
Gonna sail the ocean, gonna spread my wings.
Gonna climb that mountain, gonna do everything (originally by Better Than Ezra).
We were standing in an empty room.
The moonlight was fallin'.
You were holdin' my hand when the car pulled up for you and I coulda spent a life with you.
But those days are over.
You were callin my name when your face faded from view.
Wasn't it you that told me?
The sun would always chase the day.
Angels fly, in the air tonight saying wasn't it just like swimmin" out on the lake?
Stars collide in the air so light or was it just like those promises that you made? On our last night.
I remember waking up with you the days doin' nothin'.
You meant more to me then, than you ever knew you were gonna be a doctor, a movie star, poet at a nobel seminar hope the the world never tore that out of you.
Angels fly in the air tonight.
Saying wasn't it just like swimmin' out on the lake?
And stars collide in the air so light or was it just like those promises you made on Our last night?
Tell me whatever happened to the things you loved?
And the songs we played and the indian days whatever happened to the things you gave away?
Like harold and martin singing I was waving as you drove away the sunlight was falling.
You were riding backwards in a dusty window pane was it just like the promises that we made?
Was it just like those promises that you made?
On our last night oh,oh,oh,whoa,whoa,yeaah, oh.
I know he loved you.
A long time ago.
I ain't jealous of you.
Just thought you should know.
You were never good enough for him or anything like me.
So you might as well sit back 'cause I'm not trying to show maturity "X" is the shape I drew through your face.
In permanent marker just like the mark you knew you were making.
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart in.
Permanent marker I found that picture of you in that green dress.
Sure had a good time.
Cleaning up that mess he found 30 other pieces but he'll never find them all.
Tried to tape it back together.
Now he knows to keep it off the wall.
And I don't appreciate you calling him to reminisce the only reason is you're seeing how much better off he is.
To write on his heart.
Oh, permanent marker.
I could've keyed your car.
I could've rolled your yard I know the passwords to your emails, everything you do I could've put 'em to good use.
But I'm dressed to kill and tonight I'm going out on a date with your best friend, he always liked me anyway r-E-V-E-N-G-E My list of things to do this week.
Jealousy, misery, gonna give you what you gave to me make you feel so B-A-D break you, make you sorry.
I hope you cry getting my R-E-V-E-N-G-E.
So I'm gonna paint the town with him replace your memory, everywhere we've ever been I don't hangout at smokey bars but I know we'll see you there.
And I'm making you hear me laugh like I just don't care.
I know you hate my friends so tonight I called 'em all later on you can expect some prank phone calls, baby s-A-N-I-T-Y, I hope you lose yours tonight.
You made me crazy too long so I'm working on baby, baby R-E-V-E-N-G-E.
Gonna give you what you gave to me (originally by Vance Joy).
I was scared of dentists and the dark I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations oh, all my friends are turning green.
You're the magician's assistant in their dreams.
Oh, and they come unstuck.
Lady, running down to the riptide.
Taken away to the dark side I wanna be your left hand man.
I love you when you're singing that song and I got a lump in my throat because you're gonna sing the words wrong.
There's this movie that I think you'll like this guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City this cowboy's running from himself.
And she's been living on the highest shelf.
I just wanna, I just wanna know If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay I just gotta, I just gotta know.
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way I swear she's destined for the screen closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh.
Oh lady, running down to the riptide I got a lump in my throat because you're gonna sing the words wrong I remember your bare feet down the hallway.
I remember your little laugh race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs I love you to the moon and back.
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine like we had our own secret club I remember you dancing before bed time.
Then jumping on me, waking me up I can still feel you hold my hand, little man.
And even the moment I knew you fought it hard like an army guy remember I leaned in and whispered to you.
Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here you were my best four years.
I remember the drive home when the blind hope turned to crying and screaming "Why?".
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say about a beautiful boy who died and it's about to be Halloween.
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here.
I remember the last day when I kissed your face.
And whispered in your ear out of this curtained room in this hospital grey, we'll just disappear.
What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
What if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?
(originally by George Strait) there's a plane or a bus leaving Dallas I hope you're on it.
If there's a train moving fast down the tracks.
I hope you caught it 'Cause I swear out there ain't where you outta be.
So catch a ride or catch a cab.
Don't you know that I miss you bad but don't you walk to me.
Baby run cut a path across the blue sky.
Straight in a straight line you can't get here fast enough.
Find a truck and fire it up.
Lean on the gas and off the clutch leave Dallas in the dust I need you in a rush.
So baby run.
Oh if you ain't got a suitcase.
Get a box or an old brown paper sack.
Pack it light or pack it heavy take a truck, take a Chevy baby just come back.
There's a shortcut to the highway out of town why don't you take it don't let that speed limit slow you down.
Go on and break it baby break it baby run.
Cut a path across the blue sky run to me oh baby run.
(feat. The Civil Wars) I remember tears streaming down your face when I said, "I'll never let you go.".
When all those shadows almost killed your light I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone," but all that's dead and gone and passed tonight.
Just close your eyes.
The sun is going down you'll be alright.
No one can hurt you now come morning light.
You and I'll be safe and sound.
Don't you dare look out your window, darling.
Everything's on fire the war outside our door keeps raging on.
Hold onto this lullaby even when the music's gone ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
La, la (la, la).
You and I'll be safe and sound...
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh I'm still wearing my blue jeans no I don't know what you mean.
I'm still the same girl.
Picking daisies in the field I believe in what I feel.
I've always been the same girl some moments change your life this could be one of them.
I'm just living life and thinking hey this could be fun.
Living in the same world singing little songs at the break of dawn girl.
Sitting on the front porch do do do do do watching what you say girl.
Never blow away girl living in the crazy world.
I still live in one small town.
But always love to move around.
Still keep diaries that say.
Where I was and did that day some days will change your life.
Yeah this could be one of them I'm just living life and thinking...
Let's watch the tide chase the waves.
Onto the sand I wonder If a broken heart.
Feel the warmth on my hand and I wonder.
What a piece of driftwood has seen all through.
His lifetime let's walk away the past through.
The smokey black nights I've seen a million things.
Spoke a million words now I only want to speak to you.
Waiting for the words counting every bird.
There's nothing I'd rather do.
On the smokey black nights.
Still throught the haze I can make out.
I'll make one of you and me.
As we sit In the sand and I saw.
That sunset gleamin as my eyes went wild.
I've played.
A thousand songs sang a thousand words to sing to you.
Waited on a wire starin' at the fire I've walked.
A thousand miles a thousand smiles now I only smile.
When I'm with you so walk with me as the sweet.
Wind dances.
I'll write a song for you and me days go by, I wonder if you here me.
Can't you read between the lines?
Now I'm standing still, I am disappearing take this chance, I'll make you mine don't you wonder why.
You change in time.
Makes you feel so empty inside but love's got me cornered in the back of the room I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around.
And all I see is someone I don't know love's got me tangled, tired me too.
No sign of a wall, sign of wall spinning me around.
And baby all I see is you he tells lies, are you really thinking.
That you deserve another try when you see these eyes you see another planet.
Don't ask how, but fate decides spinning and turning and living and learning.
I should be able to handle this.
Make it or break it.
Move it or shake it.
Do it or fake it girl you've got to make it.
And all I see is you let me know, how's it feel to be under my skin, wrapped around my heart.
Is it like anywhere you've been?
And everything I do, I do it just for you so why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Are you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed.
Stupid boy I have been looking in, trying to read your mind give you the benefit of the doubt, every single time.
And then you walk right by, I'm screaming out inside why the hell don't you love me?
What happens when you wake up, to see that you've lost?
You take one look at me, 'cause that's what it cost.
I was gonna be everything you need.
'Cause you're everything to me let me know, how's it feel to be under my skin hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh.
Only sound, only sound that you hear is "No".
You never saw it coming slipped when you started running and now you've come undone and I, I, I, I.
Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees, eh eh seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade wish I could make it better.
Someday you won't remember this pain you thought would last forever and ever.
There you'll stand, ten feet tall.
I will say, "I knew it all along." your eyeswider than distance.
This lifesweeter than fiction just a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh oh.
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes they never saw it coming.
You hit the ground running and now you're onto something, I, I, I say.
What a sight, what a sight when the light came on proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong.
And in this perfect weather It's like we don't remember.
The rain we thought would last forever and ever there you'll stand, next to me.
All at once, the rest is history.
This lifesweeter than fiction, fiction I'll be one of the many saying.
"Look at you now, look at you now, now.".
"You made us proud, you made us proud, proud.".
And when they call your name and they put your picture in a frame you know that I'll be there time and again.
'Cause I loved you when, when you only sound, only sound that you heard was "No".
Now in this perfect weather.
The rain we thought would last forever and ever (forever).
There you'll stand next to me It's sweeter than fiction It's sweeter, yeah.
It's sweeter than, sweeter sweeter than fiction (originally by Gwen Stefani).
If I could be sweet I would but first of all, let me say.
I must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor.
Its your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator.
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold If I could escape and recreate a place that's my own world.
And I could be your favorite girl forever, perfectly together.
Now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet sorry, but I know I've been a real bad girl I didn't mean for you to get hurt.
We can make it better sweet escape, sweet escape.
You let me drown I'm at my lowest boiling point.
Come help me out I need to get me out of this joint.
Come on, let's bounce counting on you to turn me around.
Instead of clowning around.
Let's look for some common ground.
Oh baby times been getting a little crazy I've been getting a little lazy.
Waiting for you to come save me I can see that you're angry.
By the way that you treat me hopefully, you don't leave me wanna take you with me.
Tire swings, summer dreams, honeysuckle on the breeze whistle County creek.
Laying in the green grass, I was watching clouds pass baby, you were watching me.
Cold barn struck bed, everything you said.
Slowly educating me I never had a lesson so sweet.
You can get high on a first kiss you can get by with sweet tea and God's graces you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner.
Nothing's shatterproof you can crash and burn and come back someone new.
And that's what I learned from you autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change just like the two of us.
Still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket guess I loved you way too much but I'm a little smarter, my heart's a little harder.
But it's still soft enough to cry.
Cause I remember those times I remember.........
Saw you just the other day all that I could think to say was.
"Hey, how have you been?" you caught me with that old smile said, "It's really been a while.
And I still think about back when..".
We used to get high on the first kiss.
We could get by with sweet tea and Jesus and you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner.
You can crash and burn and now I'm someone new oh, that's what I learned from you.
That's what I learned from you, oh you, oh.
That's what I learned from you, oh yeah.
It was something like a perfect start to this love yesterday but now who are you.
I thought I knew your eyes how to know to look right through me It's like you forgot the words you whispered to me.
They weren't true It's like it wasn't you.
Could you tell me what did I do.
Because it can't be we're already through did you sell me out for a fool after you held me is that just what you do.
What did you need from me tell me take time to realize I know.
That people change their minds but that was something I wished you would say to my face.
But you run away If I had a reason or a simple goodbye baby even a lie.
Yeah Yeah tell me what did I do because baby suddenly we're already through.
And tell me ooooh Yeah tell Me.
You were what I wanted when I wanted what I just couldn't have.
You were country lovin' really somethin' for three months and a half everybody said that you were bad news but baby I was betting on you.
So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack got myself a big country serving to pay back.
Now I'm gonna have to listen to my mumma's "I told you so" but you weren't even worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack.
I said let them say we're crazy, you said let's go fishing a lot.
The midnight moon was blazing baby, I was gazing into your eyes everything changed when you took me to town.
Caught you staring every other girl down.
Can't believe the time you lost me can't believe what it cost me cause I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack.
Got myself a big ol serving to pay back.
I had to listen to my mumma's "I told you so" you ain't never been through that you ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack.
I said I know he said need some time, need some space to think about all of this.
I watched him go he watched me crushed to the floor.
On my knees, just like that.
He said, "When can I come back?".
I said, that's when I wake up in the morning.
That's when after sun is always storming.
Laughing when I'm crying that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate.
That's when never see your face.
I let you in, baby that's when he said I did you wrong, made mistakes.
Put you through all of this 'Cause I let you go, you let me think.
That I'll be fine without you Imagine that!
So baby I'll come back.
That's when I'll never see your face.
And I said all this playing did you ever think of me?
That's when I woke up in the morning laughing when I was crying!
And that's when we will waiting up to f*ckin'.
That's when I saw your face to let me in, baby that's when he said I need some time, need some space.
Should have been different but It wasn't different, was it same old story, dear john.
And so long should have fit like a glove should have fit like a ring.
Like a diamond ring a token of true love should have all worked out.
But it didn't.
She should be here now.
But she isn't there's your trouble you keep seeing double.
With the wrong one.
You can't see I love you you can't see she doesn't but you just keep holding on.
So now you're thinking 'bout.
All you're missing how deep you're sinking round and round and dragging down.
Why don't you cash in your chips.
Why don't you call it a loss not such a big loss chalk it up better luck.
Could have been true love but it wasn't.
It should all add up.
But it doesn't Im a laid back t-shirt, blue jean, mood ring.
Kinda girl hey yeah whats the word on you.
Lay low Im a mission rebel angel devil little left of the middle.
Sometimes I get temperamental.
But here I am an open book turn the page its all the rage.
Get a look on the inside oh what you get is what you see.
Baby you hold the key to the diary of me Im poetry, complicated.
Simply stated.
Hey yeah baby how about you I was born free.
Im a cell phone hippie.
Are you with me?
When I mess up I dont get up.
I just get down yeah Its raining on Sunday.
Theres nothing on TV.
Yesterday was lonely youre the only one who gets me.
My mind is like an island drifting through the ocean.
I cant stop thinking about you I bet youre thinking of me too well here I am an open book.
Yeah here I am an open book.
Stumble up the porch step.
You sat down in the car.
Only thirteen blocks across this town.
To get to where you are.
And that dont offer me much time to make up my mind so I best be driving slow.
On my way to letting go these headlights they just wanna fade off into the night.
But if theyre half as stubborn as me theyll just keep on shining bright I aint ever been one to settle like.
The dust does on the dash.
Since the feeling aint strong.
Ill just move on and leave this in my past once you're gone I know your memory'll.
Somehow get the best of me so I question everything I do.
Unsure of turning you away wondering love how Ill act today.
Until you find somebody new so Ive been holding on way too long.
But not another minute.
I'm gonna miss you bad but cant call it love if you aint in it red light turns to green.
Then back to red again I wish there were some other travelers out here to slow my travelling.
Even though the wheel rolled on Inside I still dont know oh and it troubles me so.
Wondering love how Ill feel today I see you found somebody new.
And Ive been holding on I might miss you bad but.
Your car comes to a rest in the drive you open up the door and I see you smile.
Walking downtown shuffling my feet I try to dream my dreams above the concrete store windows, traveled for miles.
But something I passed really caught my eye.
It was cracked down the middle, permanent scars but I fell in love with this here guitar.
Nice to meet you, can I teach you all I know, can you show me what you do where have you been.
What have you seen who were you before you even knew me.
Have you been played for endless hours or were you left in the corner or were you someone's best friend.
This here guitar It was my baby, anyone could see.
I love the cracks, the curves, the hidden beauty but I can't help wondering why.
It came to me and where we'll say goodbye the cracks down the middle can't see where they are.
Since I fell in love with this here guitar.
Were you a present from a father to a son did he forget you.
Or just play you 'til you came undone.
Hey did some prima donna love you.
'Til she got her fame and fortune I won't do that to you nice to meet you, I can teach you.
All I know, you can show me what you do and I played you for endless hours.
Never left you in the corner.
You're my one and only friend now I know where life lessons are you're my guitar.
Beneath the chandelier of stars and atmosphere tangled like the roots on the ground the windows opened up.
The wind is blowing and we're both not making a sound.
Its like Im melting on into you give me a reason why we should ever move youll never leave me.
and Im not crazy and this is really happening that this is really happening.
Could this be better?
You write me letters so you see me everyday you tend to treat me like.
My name is up in lights It really blows me away lock me up in a dark room.
And I still cant take my eyes off you all those kisses up against your car.
For all those wishes on planes we thought were stars.
Memories like photographs oh Baby,Here we are oh,This is really happening.
Youll always need me that I drive you crazy and this is really happening.
Oh,that this is really happening tell me,Oh.
(need me,tell me).
(feat. T-Pain).

What, What, Don't test me (Beep).
Hey, Hold on, hold on I didn't even say anything I- (What?) I said Yo (yup).
You guys bleeped me and I didn't even say anything.
I didn't swear (She didn't even swear) hello? Ugh!
Do you remember the day I leaned up against your car.
And it started rolling down the street you screamed and ran after it and tried to open the door.
And it ran over your foot and I was too busy laughing on the ground to see.
It would take Brad Pitt to leave you.
It takes five seconds to need you when I'm mad at all the lovebirds.
'Cause they don't know to play our song I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me.
'Cause that's where you belong until Brad Pitt comes along.
Do you remember the time we watched Carrie and you said it reminded you of me.
And I threw the remote at you.
And you said "my point exactly" and later on that night, under the neon city lights you paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me.
You call me lucky 'cause I lose everything but I swear I'd be careful with it If you gave me a ring.
And it would take Brad Pitt to leave you 'Cause they don't play our song I wish that pretty girls wouldn't see you.
'Til Brad Pitt comes along yeah, oh oh today was a fairytale.
You were the prince I used to be a damsel in distress.
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six I wore a dress.
You wore a dark grey t-shirt you told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess.
Time slows down whenever you're around.
Can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me fell in love when I saw you standing there It must have been the way.
You've got a smile that takes me to another planet every move you make everything you say is right.
All that I can say.
Is now it's getting so much clearer nothing made sense until the time I saw your face yeah yeah.
But can you feel this magic in the air?
I can feel my heart.
It's beating in my chest did you feel it?
I can't put this down.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, oh, oh.
Are you trying to make me fall 'Cause with a face like that baby.
It won't take too long.
Keep on melting me with those eyes and I think in a while I'll be hypnotized.
Sitting here singing ooh, ooh, I love you I love you ooh, ooh, come a little closer.
Oh, oh, I love you I love you.
And I'm down to my last breath trying to get my heels back under my head.
Baby somewhere around the time.
The moment I saw you with your hair all sticking up.
I was all caught up 'Cause baby you were so damn cute I need you to need me.
See the train is coming for me help me, save me from this crash at last.
Na na na na na na na na na you seem to be just what I've tried to find.
And your name looks so good written next to mine next to mine ooh, ooh I really really want you.
Oh, oh I love you I love you oh, oh..
I used to rule the world.
Seas would rise when I gave the word now in the morning I sleep alone.
Sweep the streets I used to own I used to roll the dice feel the fear in my enemy's eyes.
Listen as the crowd would sing now the old king is dead! Long live the king!
One minute I held the keys.
Next the doors were closed on me and I discovered that my castles stand upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand.
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing roman Cavalry choirs are singing be my mirror, my sword and shield.
My missionaries in a foreign field for some reason I can't explain.
Once you go there was never.
Never an honest word but that was when I ruled the world It was a wicked and wild wind.
Blew down the doors to let me in.
Shattered windows and the sound of drums people couldn't believe what I'd become revolutionaries wait.
For my head on a silver plate just a puppet on a lonely string.
Oh who would ever wanna be king?
I know Saint Peter won't call my name.
If you had only gotten to me first.
If I could write a book on how this hurts If you could see the way your smile looks to me.
If I wasn't scared of the world alone If I didn't know he loves me so.
If I could only find the strength to leave you'd be with me, so baby don't you look in my eyes.
I might fall in love with a beautiful boy.
I wish that I could touch you go I hope you think of me as the stars fall down and the heavens fade.
This girl is begging wait for me.
It's so wrong that all I wanna do.
Is forget it all and just be with you I have to go 'cause he don't know but the writing's on the wall.
But here we are in so deep soaking wet jumping in without no safety net.
And I don't know what kinda ropes.
Would break this kinda fall, so baby you go, I hope you think of me this girl is begging wait, wait for me.
We can't be together right now guess there's no use in trying.
But if you look at me right now can you tell that I'm dying.
To hold you but it would be wrong to.
So don't you look in my eyes don't you look now.
I got a little thing I call self control.
'Cause I get a little crazy.
When I let too much go loves a little messy and you are too right now Im scared of both of you.
I laugh and I play and I wasnt gonna stray swore Id never let a man in my way.
Youre the last thing I needed today and I dont know where I lost control.
And couldnt take it any longer must have been somewhere between.
Your smile and the way you say my name I cant win so I give in the more I fight it just gets stronger.
Youre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction welcome distraction, welcome distraction gone and spilled my coffee.
Tryna get to the phone 'Cause it might be you you just never know.
Cant talk to my friends without you coming up.
Its even kind of cute the way you cuss.
I wrote your name down.
A hundred thousand times.
'Cause it looks so good right next to mine youre the last thing I needed tonight.
Welcome distraction Im acting like a girl.
With nothing to lose when did I stop caring.
About anything but you welcome distraction, welcome distraction oh oh we used to walk along the street.
When the porch lights were shining bright before I had somewhere to be.
Back when we had all night and we were happy.
I do recall a good while back.
We snuck into the circus you threw your arms around my neck.
Back when I deserved it.
When it was good baby It was good baby.
We showed 'um all up no one could touch the way we laughed in the dark.
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday.
We used to watch the sun go down.
On the boats in the water that's sorta how I feel right now.
And Goodbye's so much harder 'Cause we were happy oh, I hate those voices.
Telling me I'm not in love anymore but they don't give me choices.
And that's what these tears are for we Were Happy.
And you were gonna marry me when we were happy yeah, We were were happy.
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh we Were happy what do you say, when you just know.
That he's the one, and you wanna go fast.
But he's taking it slow and what do you do, when he's next to you.
But he's a little bit shy well here's something you can try.
Hey, hey what do you say we go walking down the river all together It's a warm May beautiful day.
And I feel like I could talk to you forever.
With the sun shining bright.
It feels just like a day.
When everything's gonna go just right.
I know it will be a sweet memory for you and me someday.
What do you say?
What do you see, when you look in his eyes.
There's something there that he can't disguise.
No matter how he tries.
And what do you feel, when you know its real and you can't sit still If you don't own up will yeah.
My imagination's running away just dreaming about.
What I want you to say she's looking in the mirror the moment's getting nearer.
She thinks about it as she walks her walk up and down the staircase make up fresh on her face.
She thinks about it as she talks her talk.
School dance, first chance always been a dreamer.
There's one guy, she's shy sees him through the mirror.
And everybody looks at her she thinks about it.
Blue dress, angel face.
Looking in the mirror.
Shoes, purse, hair tied back and you should see her she's got her magic.
Floating through the air peace, love.
One thing leads into another.
Dream big, aim small man you gotta love her.
She's got her hopes up got 'em up to there.
Wondering what to wear she's standing in her bedroom.
He'll be pulling up soon.
She thinks about it when she sees headlights looking out the window.
She's got her diary to show that she's been waiting for this all her life first date, can't wait.
Heart all wrapped up wait until he sees her.
He's looking right at her sixteen blue jeans, Abercrombie T-shirt.
The years went by the mirror saw her cry.
She got up again the wind blew by the small town lights.
Move out, find out.
Where the world can take her.
Bright lights, late nights living for the greater move to Paris.
Living on a prayer ohh, oh, oh.
You walk in here with your guitar man your shining boots and your full on band.
A smile on your face, a knife in your hand.
Singing songs you've got memorized with whatever talent money buys so polished that it slips right through your hands.
But don't ruin yourself I ain't your competition don't flatter yourself that was never my intention.
I wanna talk about what you are that I ain't let's talk about what you do that I can't let's talk about me and you and that empty room and who wins.
Let's talk about what you did to get here let's talk about blood and sweat and tears.
Let's talk about what you want to be and who I've always been.
I walk in here with a beat up case.
The same guitar I've always played and the words i wrote down on a page.
When i was 12 years old a small town raised.
You tell the crowd you're paying dues I tell them, "this is what I do" and its what i put my life into.
As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume and say life on musical road is rough conditions but the easy ride was never my ambition.
Let's talk about your childhood days you were the prom queen, I was on this stage.
So where's that crown gotten you these days?
When it's me and you and the same damn games so what have you got that I ain't?
And what can you do that I can't?
Let's put me and you in an empty room and see who wins let's talk about what you wanna be, girl, and who I've always been.
I can't believe you did it again.
Walked by and took my heart with you.
Why did you have to look so good?
Don't you know that I'm trying to hate you trying to have a dream without you in it but how can I put out this fire.
When you're the one who lit it.
I can't wait for the day I stop pretending that I'm really ok when I'm not.
I want to know how it feels to be.
Over you for real.
Until I do.
I'll keep writing songs about you I've got a stack of papers so high and it's all about you baby.
Keep thinking maybe I.
Can make sense of something crazy.
Something I can't get out of my Head I write your name I write your name then I tear it all to shreds.
And if you ever change your mind.
And want me back again I hope these songs will remind me why I shouldn't let you in.
That I'm really ok cause I'm not.
I'll just wait for the day.
I stop pretending I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real.
Till I do.
I bet you lie awake at night trying to make up your sweet mind.
Wondering if you'll ever find just what you want.
A home-town number one.
Or a California loaded gun.
But you know you only get one or that's what you thought but here's what you've got.
I could be your favorite blue jeans with the holes in the knees In the bottom of the top drawer.
I could be your little beauty queen.
Just a little outta reach or the girl living next door I'll be your angel giving up her wings.
If that's what you need I'd give everything to be your anything.
If you want hard to get If you want...
All you have to do is let me know If you want a bumpy ride.
Or someone with a softer side.
Either one'll be alright just let me know.
Cause this is where it goes It's not like I'm giving up who I am for you.
but for someone like you it's just so easy to do I heard a song tonight on the radio.
Another girl sings about a boy.
Just sees his face in every space in every room and i know that if i turn around you won't be there.
If i close my eyes will you be there?
I don't wanna lose your face and i don't wanna wake one day.
And not remember what time erased.
And i don't wanna turn around.
Coz i'm not scared of what love gave me and took away.
And i don't wanna lose your face.
I've got a picture of you in my bedroom and i hope it never falls.
And i hope i never lose that feeling.
I used to get when you would call and now i wonder to myself who were you and where are you?
Were you ever here at all?
That girl in the song had it so good I wish i could close my eyes and see you I wish the sky had your face.
And the oceans had your eyes.
And the sunset had your lips and i had you.
Here I am, once again.
In your driveway, thinking I should be leaving I should go but it's so entertaining watching you breathing.
You went and got to me like.
The stupid song on the radio that you try to forget.
But it sticks in your head.
So goodbye, it's not goodnight cause I'll be seeing you in my dreamin'.
Boy, you got me like a shot to the heart.
Got me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car.
Caught a red light I ran right through gotta call my friends, tell them all about you always looking like a one of those nights.
When you're thinkin' about a kiss 'til the morning light you got me, you do.
In a daze, pull the shades.
Close my eyes and picture you at my window I relax; I go back to all the things you said that only I know.
Gotta call my all my friends, tell them all about you I run right out to my car.
And I pull out the drive.
It's only been ten minutes but I have to see you one more time cause you got me like a shot to the heart.
Got me shakin' so bad, I spilled my coffee in the car and it's looking like a one of those nights.
