He said the way my blue eyes shined put those Georgia stars to shame that night.
I said, "That's a lie." just a boy in a Chevy truck.
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck on back roads at night.
And I was right there beside him all summer long and then the time we woke up to find that summer gone.
But when you think Tim McGraw I hope you think my favorite song.
The one we danced to all night long the moon like a spotlight on the lake.
When you think happiness I hope you think that little black dress.
Think of my head on your chest and my old faded blue jeans.
When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think of me.
September saw a month of tears and thankin' God that you weren't here.
To see me like that but in a box beneath my bed.
Is a letter that you never read from three summers back.
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet and lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe.
And I'm back for the first time since then I'm standin' on your street.
And there's a letter left on your doorstep and the first thing that you'll read is:.
Someday you'll turn your radio on I hope it takes you back to that place.
Oh, think of me he said the way my blue eyes shined.
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night I said, "That's a lie.".
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me.
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy that's fine I'll tell mine that you're gay!
That's fine you won't mind if I say by the way...
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive.
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying.
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time.
As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn!
There's no time for tears I'm just sitting here planning my revenge.
There's nothing stopping me from going out with all of your best friends.
And if you come around saying sorry to me my daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be.
And if you're missing me you'd better keep it to yourself.
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health...
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck In case you haven't heard I really really hate that...
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn you're just another picture to burn.
Baby, burn... drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see.
That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about.
And she's got everything that I have to live without. drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it's just so funny.
Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny that I can't even see anyone when he's with me.
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night.
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star.
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly the kind of flawless I wish I could be.
She better hold him tight, give him all her love look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause.
So I drive home alone. as I turn out the light.
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight.
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar the only one who's got enough of me to break my heart.
he's the time taken up, but there's never enough.
And he's all that I need to fall into. I don't know what I want, so don't ask me cause I'm still trying to figure it out.
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking trying to see through the rain coming down.
Even though I'm not the only one who feels the way I do.
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on.
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world got the radio on, my old blue jeans.
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve feeling lucky today, got the sunshine.
Could you tell me what more do I need and tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah.
But that's ok maybe I'm just a girl on a mission.
But I'm ready to fly I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know.
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know.
Oh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world oh I'm just a girl.
Oh I'm just a girl, oh, oh You have a way of coming easily to me and when you take, you take the very best of me.
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something and you do what you want cause I'm not what you wanted.
Oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day just walk away, no use defending words that you will never say.
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through I've never been anywhere cold as you.
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray and I stood there loving you and wished them all away.
And you come away with a great little story of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you.
You never did give a damn thing honey but I cried, cried for you and I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you.
(Died for you) oh what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day.
Every smile you fake is so condescending counting all the scars you made.
I didn't know what I would find when I went looking for a reason, I know.
I didn't read between the lines and, baby, I've got nowhere to go.
I tried to take the road less traveled by but nothing seems to work the first few times.
Am I right? so how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in I can still see you, this ain't the best view.
On the outside looking in I've been a lot of lonely places.
I've never been on the outside you saw me there, but never knew.
I would give it all up to be a part of this, a part of you.
And now it's all too late so you see you could've helped if you had wanted to.
But no one notices until it's too late to do anything.
So how can I ever try to be better? nobody ever lets me in.
I can still see you, this ain't the best view on the outside looking in.
I've been a lot of lonely places I've never been on the outside.
Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty Is the face in the mirror looking back at you.
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty but that's not true, cause I know you...
Hold on, baby, you're losing it the water's high, you're jumping into it.
And letting go... and no one knows that you cry, but you don't tell anyone.
That you might not be the golden one and you're tied together with a smile.
But you're coming undone I guess it's true that love was all you wanted.
Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change hoping it will end up in his pocket.
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain oh, cause it's not his price to pay.
Not his price to pay... you're tied together with a smile.
But you're coming undone... oh goodbye, baby.
With a smile, baby, baby cory's eyes are like a jungle.
He smiles, it's like the radio he whispers songs into my window.
In words that nobody knows there's pretty girls on every corner.
That watch him as he's walking home saying, "Does he know?".
Will you ever know? you're beautiful.
Every little piece love and don't you know.
You're really gonna be someone ask anyone.
And when you find everything you looked for I hope your life lead you back to my door.
Oh, but if it don't stay beautiful.
Cory finds another way to be the highlight of my day.
I'm taking pictures in my mind so I can save them for a rainy day.
It's hard to make a conversation when he's taking my breath away.
I should say, hey, by the way... If you and I are a story.
That never gets told If what you are is a daydream.
I'll never get to hold at least you'll know...
You're beautiful every little piece love.
And don't you know you're really gonna be someone.
Ask anyone. and when you find everything you looked for.
I hope your life lead you back to my front door. oh, but if it don't.
Will you stay beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful la la la.
Oh, oh, oh, oh Stay beautiful Na, na, na, na, na It's strange to think the songs we used to sing.
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone yesterday I found out about you.
Even now just looking at you feels wrong you say that you'd take it all back, given one chance.
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes." you should've said "No", you should've gone home.
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go you should've known that word, with what you did with her.
Get back to me (get back to me). and I should've been there in the back of your mind.
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?" you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
You should've said "No", baby, and you might still have me you can see that I've been crying.
Baby, you know all the right things to say but do you honestly expect me to believe.
We could ever be the same? you say that the past is the past, you need one chance.
I can't resist.
Before you go, tell me this: was it worth it?
Was she worth this? no... no, no, no...
She said, I was seven and you were nine I looked at you like the stars that shined.
In the sky, the pretty lights and our daddies used to joke about the two of us.
Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes and said oh my my my.
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me.
You never did, you never did take me back when our world was one block wide.
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried just two kids, you and I...
Oh my my my my well, I was sixteen when suddenly.
I wasn't that little girl you used to see but your eyes still shined like pretty lights.
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us they never believed we'd really fall in love.
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes and said oh my my my...
Take me back to the creek beds we turned up two A.M. riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me.
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight the slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight.
You stayed outside till the morning light oh my my my my.
A few years had gone and come around we were sitting at our favorite spot in town.
And you looked at me, got down on one knee take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle.
Our whole town came and our mamas cried you said I do and I did too.
Take me home where we met so many years before we'll rock our babies on that very front porch.
After all this time, you and I I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine.
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine In the sky, oh my my my...
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone.
In the front seat of his car he's got a one-hand feel.
On the steering wheel the other on my heart.
I look around, turn the radio down he says, "Baby is something wrong?".
I say, "Nothing. I was just thinking.
How we don't have a song." and he says...
Our song is the slamming screen door sneakin' out late, tapping on your window.
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow 'Cause it's late and your mama don't know.
Our song is the way you laugh the first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have.".
And when I got home ... 'fore I said, "Amen." asking God if he could play it again.
I was walking up the front porch steps.
After everything that day had gone all wrong.
And been trampled on and lost and thrown away.
Got to the hallway well, on my way.
To my lovin' bed I almost didn't notice.
All the roses and the note that said,..
I've heard every album, listened to the radio waited for something to come along.
That was as good as our song... 'Cause our song is the slamming screen door.
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window when we're on the phone and he talks real slow.
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know our song is the way he laughs.
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss him, when I should have." and when I got home ... 'fore I said, "Amen.".
Asking God if he could play it again play it again.
Oh, yeah... oh-oh, yeah.
I grabbed a pen.
And an old napkin and I wrote down our song.
Friday night beneath the stars in a field behind your yard.
you and I are paintin' pictures in the sky. and sometimes we don't say a thing;.
just listen to the crickets sing. everything I need is right here by my side.
And I know everything about you I don't wanna live without you.
I'm only up when you're not down. don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground.
It's like no matter what I do. well you drive me crazy half the time;.
the other half I'm only trying to let you know that what I feel is true. and I'm only me when I'm with you.
Just a small town boy and girl livin' in a crazy world.
Tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true. and I don't try to hide my tears.
The secrets or my deepest fears. through it all nobody gets me like you do.
And you know everything about me. you say that you can't live without me.
When I'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself. only you can tell.
That I'm only up when you're not down. and I'm only me.
Who I wanna be well, I'm only me when I'm with you.
With you uh huh.
She can't see the way your eyes light up when you smile.
She'll never notice how you stop and stare whenever she walks by.
And you can't see me wantin' you the way you want her but you are everything to me.
I just wanna show you she don't even know you.
She's never gonna love you like I want to. and you just see right through me.
If you only knew me we could be a beautiful.
Instead of just invisible. there's a fire inside of you.
That can't help but shine through. she's never gonna see the light.
No matter what you do. and all I think about is how to make you think of me.
And everything that we could be like shadows in a faded light.
Oh, we're invisible. I just wanna open your eyes.
And make you realize. I just wanna show you.
She don't even know you. baby, let me love you.
Let me want you. you just see right through me.
But if you only knew me she can't see the way your eyes.
Light up when you smile. why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now? why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart? maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall.
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall. no matter what you say, I still can't believe.
That you would walk away. It don't make sense to me, but:.
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar? It's not unbroken anymore. how do I get it back the way it was before?
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart,now?
why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a:.
I like the way you sound in the morning we're on the phone and without a warning.
I realize your laugh is the best sound I have ever heard.
I like the way I can't keep my focus I watch you talk, you didn't notice.
I hear the words but all I can think is we should be together.
Every time you smile, I smile and every time you shine, I'll shine for you.
Whoa, oh, I'm feeling you baby don't be afraid to.
Jump then fall jump then fall into me.
Be there, never gonna leave you say that you wanna be with me too.
So I'mma stay through it all so jump then fall.
Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face you got the keys to me.
I love each freckle on your face, oh I've never been so wrapped up, honey.
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted I had time to think it all over.
And all I can say is come closer take a deep breath then jump then fall into me.
Cause Every time you smile, I smile The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet I'll catch you, I'll catch you.
And people say things that bring you to your knees I'll catch you.
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry but I'll hold you through the night until you smile.
Whoa, oh, I need you baby don't be afraid, please.
Jump then fall, baby jump then fall into me, into me.
and every time you shine, I shine.
And every time you're here baby I'll show you, I'll show you.
You can Jump then fall, jump then fall jump then fall into me, into me, yeah.
Untouchable like a distant diamond sky, Mmmm I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why.
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you untouchable, burning brighter than the sun.
And when you're close I feel like coming undone In the middle of the night.
When I'm in this dream It's like a million little stars.
Spelling out your name you gotta come on, come on.
Say that we'll be together come on, come on.
Little taste of Heaven It's half full and I won't wait here all day.
I know you're saying that you'll be here anyway but you're untouchable.
Burning brighter than the sun now that you're close I feel like coming undone.
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream.
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name.
You gotta come on, come on say that we'll be together.
Come on, come on oh, In the middle of the night.
Waking from this dream I wanna feel you by my side.
Standing next to me oh, oh I'm caught up in you.
Oh, oh, oh untouchable burning brighter than the sun.
come on, come on, oh oh.
Oh, Oh, In the middle of the night waking from this dream.
I wanna feel you by my side standing next to me.
little taste of Heaven.
Like a million little stars, spelling out your name Once upon a time I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye.
And we caught onto something I hold onto the night.
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me were you just kidding cause it seems to me.
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak I don't feel welcome anymore.
Baby, what happened, please tell me cause one second it was perfect.
Now you're half way out the door and I stare at the phone.
He still hasn't called and then you feel so low.
You can't feel nothing at all and you flashback to.
When he said forever and always oh, and it rains in your bedroom.
Everything is wrong It rains when you're here.
And it rains when you're gone I was there when you said forever and always.
Was I out of line? did I say something way too honest?
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy I looked into your eyes.
Thought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure so here's to everything coming down to nothing.
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore and it rains in your bedroom.
You didn't mean it baby I don't think so, oh oh oh.
Back up, baby back up did you forget everything?
please back up, oh back up.
cause it rains in your bedroom.
And I stare at the phone he still hasn't called.
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all.
And you flashback to when we said forever and always.
Cause it rains in your bedroom everything is wrong.
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone.
I was there when you said forever and always you didn't mean it baby.
You said forever and always, yeah I could go back to every laugh.
But I don't wanna' go there anymore and I know all the steps up to your door.
But I don't wanna' go there anymore. talk to the wind, talk to the sky.
Talk to the man with the reasons why and let me know what you find.
I'll leave my window open 'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name.
Just know I'm right here hopin' that you'll come in with the rain.
I could stand up and sing you a song but I don't wanna' have to go that far.
And I, I've got you down I know you by heart.
And you don't even know where I start. talk to yourself, talk to the tears.
Talk to the man who put you here and don't wait for the sky to clear.
'Cus I'm too tired at night to call your name.
Oh, just know I'm right here hopin' I've watched you so long screamed your name.
I don't know what else I can say. but I'll leave my window open.
'Cus I'm too tired at night for all these games. just know I'm right here hopin'.
That you'll come in with the rain. But I don't wanna' go there anymore... this is wrong but I can't help but feel like.
There ain't nothing more right babe misty morning comes again and I can't.
Help but wish I could see your face and I knew from the first note played.
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you you smile that beautiful smile and.
All the girls in the front row scream your name so dim that spotlight, tell me things like.
I can't take my eyes off of you I'm no one special, just another.
Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar.
Good morning loneliness, comes around when I'm not dreaming about you.
When my world wakes up today you'll be in another town.
And I knew when I saw your face, I'd be counting down the ways to see you.
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row scream your name.
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like I can't take my eyes off of you.
I'm no one special, just another wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you.
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar you played in bars, you play guitar.
I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are and you'll never see, sing me to sleep.
Every night from the radio Sweet, sweet superstar, superstar In the heat of the fight I walked away.
Ignoring words that you were saying trying to make me stay.
I said, "This time I've had enough." and you've called a hundred times.
But I'm not picking up 'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over.
But if you look a little closer I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you.
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles screaming, "I'm in love with you.".
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more and don't you leave 'cause I know.
All I need is on the other side of the door me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone.
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone I keep going back over things we both said.
And I remember the slamming door and all the things that I misread so babe if you know everything, tell me why you couldn't see.
When I left I wanted you to chase after me yeah, I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you.
and I'll scream out the window.
I can't even look at you I don't need you but I do, I do, I do.
I say, "There's nothing you can say to make this right again. I mean it, I mean it.".
What I mean is... I said, "Leave," but baby all I want is you.
with your face and the beautiful eyes.
And the conversation with the little white lies and the faded picture of a beautiful night.
You carry me from your car up the stairs and I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress after everything I must confess, I need you.
There's somethin' 'bout the way the street looks when it's just rained.
There's a glow off the pavement you walk me to the car.
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there In the middle of the parking lot.
Oh yeah we're drivin' down the road.
I wonder if you know I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now.
But you're just so cool run your hands through your hair.
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you and I don't know how it gets better than this.
You take my hand and drag me head first and I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress.
So, baby, drive slow 'Til we run out of road in this one horse town.
I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat you put your eyes on me.
In this moment now capture it, remember it 'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this.
Well, you stood there with me in the doorway my hands shake.
I'm not usually this way but you pull me in and I'm a little more brave.
It's the first kiss It's flawless.
Really something It's fearless.
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this you take my hand and drag me head first.
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress oh yeah.
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors It's the morning of your very first day.
You say "Hi" to your friends you ain't seen in a while try and stay out of everybody's way.
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here for the next four years in this town.
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say "You know I haven't seen you around before.".
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you you're gonna believe them.
And when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out.
Well, count to ten, take it in this is life before you know who you're gonna be.
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail and soon enough you're best friends.
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool we'll be out of here as soon as we can.
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car and you're feeling like flying.
And your mamma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one and you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends.
When the night ends 'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you.
You're gonna believe them when you're fifteen.
And your first kiss makes your head spin round but in your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy on the football team.
But I didn't know it at fifteen when all you wanted was to be wanted.
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday.
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine and Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind.
And we both cried and when you're fifteen.
Don't forget to look before you fall I've found time can heal most anything.
And you just might find who you're supposed to be I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
your very first day.
Take a deep breath, girl take a deep breath as you walk through the doors.
We were both young when I first saw you. I close my eyes and the flashback starts:.
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air. see the lights, see the party, the ball gowns.
See you make your way through the crowd and say, "Hello.".
Little did I know... that you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles.
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet." and I was crying on the staircase.
Begging you, "Please don't go." and I said...
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone. I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes".
So I sneak out to the garden to see you. we keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew.
So close your eyes escape this town for a little while.
Oh, oh. 'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter.
but you were everything to me.
I was begging you, "Please don't go." You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess. Romeo, save me. They're trying to tell me how to feel. this love is difficult but it's real.
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess. Oh, oh, oh. I got tired of waiting.
Wondering if you were ever coming around. my faith in you was fading.
When I met you on the outskirts of town. Romeo, save me. I've been feeling so alone. I keep waiting for you, but you never come.
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think. he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said...
Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone. I love you, and that's all I really know.
I talked to your dad - go pick out a white dress Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 'Cause we were both young when I first saw you.
Hey Stephen I know looks can be deceiving.
But I know I saw a light in you. and as we walked.
We were talking - I didn't say half the things I wanted to.
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold.
boy, you might have me believing.
I don't always have to be alone. 'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel.
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain. so come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you.
Can't help it if there's no one else. mmm, I can't help myself.
I've been holding back this feeling.
So I've got some things to say to you, ha. I seen it all -.
So I thought - but I never seen nobody shine the way you do.
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name - It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change.
why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same. they're dimming the street lights.
You're perfect for me, why aren't you here tonight? I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out and pull me near to shine, shine, shine.
I could give you fifty reasons.
Why I should be the one you choose. all those other girls -.
Well, they're beautiful but would they write a song for you?
I can't help it if you look like an angel can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain.
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you. can't help it if there's no one else.
Mmm, I can't help myself... ...if you look like an angel.
Can't help myself I can't help myself.
Say you're sorry that face of an angel.
Comes out just when you need it to as I paced back and forth all this time.
'Cause I honestly believed in you holding on.
The days drag on stupid girl.
I should have known, I should have known that I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale.
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet lead her up the stairwell.
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town I was a dreamer before you went and let me down.
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around maybe I was na"ive.
Got lost in your eyes and never really had a chance.
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love you had to fight to have the upper hand.
I had so many dreams about you and me.
Happy endings now I know.
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet.
Lead her up the stairwell this ain't Hollywood, this is a small town.
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around.
And there you are on your knees begging for forgiveness, begging for me.
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry 'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale.
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well this is a big world, that was a small town.
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now and it's too late for you and your white horse.
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to catch me now oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Try and catch me now oh, it's too late.
To catch me now you're on the phone with your girlfriend.
She's upset, she's going off about something that you said 'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do.
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night. I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like.
And she'll never know your story like I do. but she wears short skirts.
I wear t-shirts she's cheer captain.
And I'm on the bleachers dreaming about the day when you wake up and find.
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time. If you could see.
That I'm the one who understands you.
Been here all along. so, why can't you see.
You belong with me you belong with me.
Walk in the streets with you in your worn out jeans I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be.
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself "Hey, isn't this easy?".
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town.
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down.
You say you're fine I know you better than that. hey, what you doing with a girl like that?
She wears high heels I wear sneakers.
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers.
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find that what you're looking for has been here the whole time.
If you could see that I'm the one.
Who understands you been here all along.
So, why can't you see Standing by and waiting at your backdoor. all this time how could you not know, baby?
Oh, I remember you driving to my house I'm the one who makes you laugh when you know you're 'bout to cry.
I know your favorite songs and you tell me about your dreams.
Think I know where you belong think I know it's with me.
Can't you see Who understands you? You belong with me. have you ever thought just maybe.
You belong with me? I see your face in my mind as I drive away cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way.
People are people, and sometimes we change our minds. but it's killing me to see you go after all this time.
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm.
Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see.
Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down now I don't know what to be without you around.
And we know it's never simple, never easy. never a clean break, no one here to save me.
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand and I can't breathe without you.
But I have to. breathe without you.
never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt.
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve. people are people, and sometimes it doesn't work out.
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out. and we know it's never simple, never easy.
Never a clean break, no one here to save me. you're the only thing I know like the back of my hand.
And I can't breathe without you but I have to.
Breathe without you It's two A.M. feelin' like I just lost a friend.
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me. It's two A.M.
Feelin' like I just lost a friend. hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me.
I'm sorry (oh) I'm sorry (mmm).
I'm sorry (eh eh) I'm sorry I took a chance, I took a shot.
And you might think i'm bulletproof, but i'm not you took a swing, I took it hard.
And down here from the ground I see who you are I'm sick and tired of your attitude.
I'm feeling like I don't know you you tell me that you love me then you cut me down.
And I need you like a heartbeat but you know you got a mean streak.
Makes me run for cover when you're around and here's to you and your temper.
Yes, I remember what you said last night and I know that you see what you're doing to me.
Tell me why.. you could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day.
Well I get so confused and frustrated forget what i'm trying to say, oh.
I'm sick and tired of your reasons I got no one to believe in.
You tell me that you want me, then push me around and I need you like a heartbeat.
But you know you got a mean streak makes me run for cover when you're around.
Here's to you and your temper yes, I remember what you said last night.
And I know that you see what you're doing to me tell me why..
Why..do you have to make me feel small so you can feel whole inside.
Why..do you have to put down my dreams so you're the only thing on my mind.
I'm sick and tired of your attitude I'm feeling like I don't know you.
You tell me that you want me then cut me down I'm sick and tired of your reasons.
I've got no one to believe in you ask me for my love then you push me around.
tell me why.
Why, tell me why I take a step back, let you go.
I told you i'm not bulletproof now you know.
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around.
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down.
And it's taken me this long baby but I figured you out.
And you're thinking we'll be fine again but not this time around.
You don't have to call anymore I won't pick up the phone.
This is the last straw don't wanna hurt anymore.
And you can tell me that you're sorry but I don't believe you baby.
Like I did before you're not sorry, no no oh.
Looking so innocent I might believe you if I didn't know.
Could've loved you all my life If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold.
And you got your share of secrets and I'm tired of being last to know.
And now you're asking me to listen cause it's worked each time before.
But you don't have to call anymore you're not sorry, no no, oh.
You're not sorry no no oh you had me crying for you honey.
And it never would've gone away, no you used to shine so bright.
But I watched all of it fade so you don't have to call anymore.
I won't pick up the phone this is the last straw.
There's nothing left to beg for and you can tell me that you're sorry.
But I don't believe you baby like I did before.
You're not sorry, no no oh He is sensible and so incredible and all my single friends are jealous.
He says everything I need to hear and it's like I couldn't ask for anything better.
He opens up my door and I get into his car and he says you look beautiful tonight.
And I feel perfectly fine but I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain.
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name you're so in love that you act insane.
And that's the way I loved you breakin' down and coming undone.
It's a roller coaster kinda rush and I never knew I could feel that much.
he respects my space.
And never makes me wait and he calls exactly when he says he will.
He's close to my mother talks business with my father.
He's charming and endearing and I'm comfortable.
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain and it's 2am and I'm cursing your name.
You're so in love that you act insane and that's the way I loved you.
Breakin' down and coming undone It's a roller coaster kinda rush.
And I never knew I could feel that much He can't see the smile I'm faking and my heart's not breaking.
Cause I'm not feeling anything at all and you were wild and crazy.
Just so frustrating intoxicating complicated, got away by some mistake and now.
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain It's 2am and I'm cursing your name.
I'm so in love that I acted insane Breaking down and coming undone and that's the way I loved you oh, oh.
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh never knew I could feel that much.
once upon a time.
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye and we caught onto something.
I hold onto the night you looked me in the eye.
And told me you loved me were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down we almost never speak.
I don't feel welcome anymore baby, what happened, please tell me?
'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're half way out the door and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all.
And you flashback to when he said forever and always It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone.
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest? made you run and hide.
Like a scared little boy? Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure so here's to everything.
Coming down to nothing here's to silence.
That cuts me to the core Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore and then you feel so low, you can't feel nothing at all.
you didn't mean it, baby.
I don't think so back up, baby, back up.
Did you forget everything? 'Cause it rains in your bedroom.
oh, I stare at the phone.
and you flashback to when we said forever and always.
And it rains in your bedroom It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone 'Cause I was there when you said forever and always.
You didn't mean it, baby you said forever and always... yeah.
I'm five years old It's getting cold.
I've got my big coat on I hear your laugh.
And look up smiling at you I run and run.
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides.
Look now -- the sky is gold I hug your legs and fall asleep.
On the way home I don't know why all the trees change in the fall.
I know you're not scared of anything at all don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away.
But I know I had the best day with you today.
I'm thirteen now and don't know how my friends.
Could be so mean I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys.
And we drive and drive until we've found a town.
Far enough away and we talk and window-shop.
Until I've forgotten all their names I don't know who I'm gonna talk to.
Now at school I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you.
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay but I know I had the best day.
With you today I have an excellent father.
His strength is making me stronger god smiles on my little brother.
Inside and out he's better than I am.
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run.
And I had the best days with you there is a video.
I found from back when I was three you set up a paint set in the kitchen.
And you're talking to me It's the age of princesses and pirate ships.
And the seven dwarfs daddy's smart.
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world now I know why all the trees change in the fall.
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong.
And I love you for giving me your eyes staying back and watching me shine.
And I didn't know if you knew so I'm taking this chance to say.
That I had the best day And it's a sad picture the final blow hits you.
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and you know it's all the same.
Another time and place repeating history and you're getting sick of it.
But I believe in whatever you do and I'll do anything to see it through.
Because these things will change can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down this revolution, the time will come.
For us to finally win and we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah.
So we've been outnumbered raided and now cornered.
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair we're getting stronger now.
Find things they never found they might be bigger.
But we're faster and never scared you can walk away, say we don't need this.
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this 'Cause these things will change.
Can you feel it now? these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down.
This revolution, the time will come for us to finally win.
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah tonight we'll stand, get off our knees.
Fight for what we've worked for all these years and the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives.
But we'll stand up champions tonight It was the night things changed.
Can you see it now? these walls that they put up to hold us back fell down.
This revolution, throw your hands up 'Cause we never gave in.
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah uh, oh, oh.
Uh, oh, oh you were in college working part time waiting tables.
Left a small town, never looked back I was a flight risk with a fear of fallin'.
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts I say, "Can you believe it?".
As we're lying on the couch the moment I can see it.
Yes, yes, I can see it now. do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time. you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter.
You are the best thing that's ever been mine. flash forward and we're taking on the world together.
And there's a drawer of my things at your place. you learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded.
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes. but we got bills to pay.
We got nothing figured out when it was hard to take.
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about. You put your arm around me for the first time do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time oh, oh, oh, oh.
And I remember that fight two-thirty AM.
As everything was slipping right out of our hands I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street.
Braced myself for the "Goodbye." 'Cause that's all I've ever known.
Then you took me by surprise you said, "I'll never leave you alone.".
You said, "I remember how we felt sitting by the water. and every time I look at you, it's like the first time.
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter. she is the best thing that's ever been mine.".
Hold on, make it last hold on, never turn back.
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter you are the best thing that's ever been mine.
(Hold on) do you believe it? (Hold on) we're gonna make it now.
(Hold on) and I can see it (Yes, yes) I can see it now (see it now, see it now...).
The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm and I'm a house of cards.
You're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin'.
But I kinda know that I won't get far and you stood there in front of me.
Just close enough to touch close enough to hope you couldn't see.
What I was thinking of drop everything now.
Meet me in the pouring rain kiss me on the sidewalk.
Take away the pain 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile.
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around.
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile my mind forgets to remind me.
You're a bad idea you touch me once and it's really something.
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be. I'm on my guard for the rest of the world.
But with you I know it's no good and I could wait patiently but I really wish you would...
Drop everything now meet me in the pouring rain.
Kiss me on the sidewalk take away the pain.
get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down.
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around I'll run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild. just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right.
And lead me up the staircase won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show. and the sparks fly...
Oh, baby, smile... I'm so glad you made time to see me. how's life? Tell me how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while. you've been good, busier than ever.
We small talk, work and the weather your guard is up and I know why.
Because the last time you saw me Is still burned in the back of your mind.
You gave me roses and I left them there to die. so this is me swallowing my pride.
Standing in front of you saying, "I'm sorry for that night," and I go back to December all the time.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you. wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right. I go back to December all the time.
These days I haven't been sleeping staying up, playing back myself leavin'.
When your birthday passed and I didn't call. and I think about summer, all the beautiful times.
I watched you laughing from the passenger side. realized I loved you in the fall.
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind you gave me all your love and all I gave you was "Goodbye".
So this is me swallowing my pride standing in front of you saying, "I'm sorry for that night.".
And I go back to December all the time. It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you.
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine. I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind.
I go back to December all the time. I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile.
So good to me, so right and how you held me in your arms that September night.
The first time you ever saw me cry. maybe this is wishful thinking.
Probably mindless dreaming but if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right.
I'd go back in time and change it but I can't. so if the chain is on your door I understand.
But this is me swallowing my pride And I go back to December... I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind All the time. I am not the kind of girl.
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion but you are not the kind of boy.
Who should be marrying the wrong girl I sneak in and see your friends.
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel and she is yelling at a bridesmaid.
Somewhere back inside a room wearing a gown shaped like a pastry.
This is surely not what you thought it would be I lose myself in a daydream.
Where I stand and say don't say "Yes", run away now.
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door don't wait or say a single vow.
You need to hear me out and they said, "Speak now.".
Fond gestures are exchanged and the organ starts to play.
A song that sounds like a death march and I am hiding in the curtains.
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be she floats down the aisle like a pageant queen.
But I know you wish it was me you wish it was me.
Don't you? I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door. Don't say "Yes", run away now I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door.
Don't wait or say a single vow your time is running out.
And they said, "Speak now." oh, la, la.
Oh, oh say a single vow.
I hear the preacher say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace." there's the silence, there's my last chance.
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me. horrified looks from everyone in the room.
But I'm only looking at you. so, don't say "Yes", run away now.
And you say, "Let's run away now I'll meet you when I'm out of my tux at the back door.
Baby, I didn't say my vows so glad you were around.
When they said, "Speak now." long were the nights when.
My days once revolved around you counting my footsteps.
Praying the floor won't fall through, again and my mother accused me of losing my mind.
But I swore I was fine you paint me a blue sky.
And go back and turn it to rain and I lived in your chess game.
But you changed the rules everyday wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight.
Well I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home, I should've known.
Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame.
Or maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away.
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand and I'll look back in regret how I ignored when they said.
"Run as fast as you can." cried the whole way home.
Dear John, I see it all now it was wrong don't you think nineteen's too young.
To be played by your dark, twisted games? when I loved you so, I should've known.
You are an expert at "Sorry" and keeping lines blurry.
Never impressed by me acing your tests all the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes.
Cause you've burned them out but I took your matches.
Before fire could catch me so don't look now.
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad empty town.
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone. don't you think I was too young.
To be messed with? the girl in the dress.
Cried the whole way home I see it all now that you're gone.
wrote you a song, you should've known.
You should've known don't you think I was too young?
You should've known. you, with your words like knives.
And swords and weapons that you use against me you have knocked me off my feet again.
Got me feeling like a nothing you, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard.
Calling me out when I'm wounded you, picking on the weaker man.
Well you can take me down with just one single blow but you don't know, what you don't know...
Someday I'll be living in a big ole city and all you're ever gonna be is mean.
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me Why you gotta be so mean? you, with your switching sides.
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation you have pointed out my flaws again.
As if I don't already see them I walk with my head down.
Trying to block you out 'cause I'll never impress you I just wanna feel okay again.
I bet you got pushed around somebody made you cold.
But the cycle ends right now 'Cause you can't lead me down that road.
And you don't know, what you don't know... someday I'll be living in a big ole city.
And all you're ever gonna be is mean someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me.
why you gotta be so mean?
And I can see you years from now in a bar talking over a football game.
With that same big loud opinion but nobody's listening.
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing.
But all you are is mean all you are is mean.
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean.
But someday I'll be living in a big ole city and all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah.
Why you gotta be so?... someday I'll be living in a big ole city (Why you gotta be so?...).
And all you're ever gonna be is mean (Why you gotta be so?...) someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me (Why you gotta be so?...).
I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us how we met and the sparks flew instantly.
and people would say, "They're the lucky ones." I used to know my place was the spot next to you.
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat 'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on.
Oh, a simple complication miscommunications lead to fall-out.
So many things that I wish you knew so many walls up I can't break through.
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking and I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now.
Next chapter. how'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy and you're doing your best to avoid me.
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us how I was losing my mind when I saw you here.
But you held your pride like you should've held me. oh, I'm scared to see the ending.
Why are we pretending this is nothing? I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how.
I've never heard silence quite this loud. now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking.
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah? I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down.
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now. this is looking like a contest.
Of who can act like they care less but I liked it better when you were on my side.
The battle's in your hands now but I would lay my armor down.
If you said you'd rather love than fight. so many things that you wish I knew.
But the story of us might be ending soon. And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now. and we're not speaking.
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate 'cause we're going down.
the end.
Your little hand's wrapped around my finger and it's so quiet in the world tonight.
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming so I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light.
To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret I'd give all I have, honey.
If you could stay like that oh darling, don't you ever grow up.
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart.
And no one will desert you just try to never grow up, never grow up.
You're in the car on the way to the movies and you're mortified your mom's dropping you off.
At 14 there's just so much you can't do and you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots.
But don't make her drop you off around the block remember that she's getting older too.
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school no one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred.
And even though you want to, just try to never grow up take pictures in your mind of your childhood room.
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home remember the footsteps, remember the words said.
And all your little brother's favorite songs I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone.
So here I am in my new apartment In a big city, they just dropped me off.
It's so much colder than I thought it would be so I tuck myself in and turn my night light on.
Wish I'd never grown up I wish I'd never grown up.
Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up I could still be little.
It could still be simple.
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up don't you ever grow up, just stay this little.
don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple.
Won't let nobody hurt you won't let no one break your heart.
And even though you want to, please try to never grow up oh, don't you ever grow up.
Oh, never grow up, just never grow up there I was again tonight.
Forcing laughter, faking smiles same old tired lonely place.
Walls of insincerity shifting eyes and vacancy.
Vanished when I saw your face all I can say is it was enchanting to meet you.
Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?" across the room your silhouette.
Starts to make its way to me the playful conversation starts.
Counter all your quick remarks like passing notes in secrecy.
And it was enchanting to meet you all I can say is I was enchanted to meet you.
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home.
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew I was enchanted to meet you.
The lingering question kept me up 2 AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake and now I'm pacing back and forth.
Wishing you were at my door I'd open up and you would say, "Hey.
It was enchanting to meet you all I know is I was enchanted to meet you.".
this night is flawless, don't you let it go.
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone I'll spend forever wondering if you knew.
I was enchanted to meet you this is me praying that.
This was the very first page not where the story line ends.
My thoughts will echo your name until I see you again.
These are the words I held back as I was leaving too soon.
please don't be in love with someone else.
Please don't have somebody waiting on you this night is sparkling, don't you let it go.
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home This night is flawless, don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone.
Please don't be in love with someone else please don't have somebody waiting on you.
"Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did" time for a little revenge.
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and... I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him.
She came along, got him alone and let's hear the applause she took him faster than you could say "sabotage".
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it I underestimated just who I was dealing with.
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum she underestimated just who she was stealing from.
She's not a saint and she's not what you think.
She's an actress, whoa she's better known.
For the things that she does on the mattress, whoa.
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys.
On the playground won't make you many friends.
She should keep in mind she should keep in mind.
There is nothing I do better than revenge she looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list.
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling.
And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things but sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know.
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go they wouldn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me.
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity she's not a saint.
And she's not what you think she's an actress, whoa.
She's better known for the things that she does.
On the mattress, whoa soon she's gonna find.
Stealing other people's toys on the playground won't.
Make you many friends there is nothing I do better than revenge.
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey.
You might have him but haven't you heard I'm just another thing for you.
To roll your eyes at, honey you might have him but I always get the last word.
do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do. Oh. I don't think you do I don't think you do.
Let's hear the applause come on show me how much better you are (so much better, yeah).
So you deserve some applause 'cause you're so much better I guess you really did it this time left yourself in your warpath.
Lost your balance on a tightrope lost your mind tryin' to get it back.
Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days? always a bigger bed to crawl into.
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything and everybody believed in you?
It's alright, just wait and see your string of lights is still bright to me.
Oh, who you are is not where you've been. you're still an innocent.
You're still an innocent. did some things you can't speak of.
But at night you live it all again you wouldn't be shattered on the floor now.
If only you had seen what you know now then wasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days?
When everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep.
Before the monsters caught up to you? It's alright, just wait and see.
Your string of lights is still bright to me oh, who you are is not what you've been.
You're still an innocent It's okay, life is a tough crowd.
32, and still growin' up now who you are is not what you did.
time turns flames to embers.
You'll have new Septembers every one of us has messed up too.
Minds change like the weather I hope you remember.
Today is never too late to be brand new Lost your balance on a tightrope. It's never too late to get it back.
You and I walk a fragile line I have known it all this time.
But I never thought I'd live to see it break It's getting dark and it's all too quiet.
And I can't trust anything now and it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake.
Oh, I'm holding my breath won't lose you again.
Something's made your eyes go cold come on, come on, don't leave me like this.
I thought I had you figured out something's gone terribly wrong.
You're all I wanted can't breathe whenever you're gone.
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted stood there and watched you walk away.
From everything we had but I still mean every word I said to you.
He will try to take away my pain and he just might make me smile.
But the whole time I'm wishing he was you instead oh, I'm holding my breath.
Won't see you again something keeps me holding on to nothing.
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this I thought I had you figured out.
Something's gone terribly wrong you're all I wanted.
Can't breathe whenever you're gone can't turn back now, I'm haunted.
I know, I know, I just know you're not gone. You can't be gone. No.
won't finish what you started.
can't go back, I'm haunted.
Never ever thought I'd see it break. never thought I'd see it...
I still remember the look on your face lit through the darkness at 1:58.
The words that you whispered for just us to know.
You told me you loved me so why did you go away?
I do recall now the smell of the rain fresh on the pavement.
I ran off the plane that July 9th.
The beat of your heart It jumps through your shirt.
I can still feel your arms but now I'll go sit on the floor.
Wearing your clothes all that I know is.
I don't know how to be something you miss I never thought we'd have a last kiss.
Never imagined we'd end like this your name, forever the name on my lips.
I do remember the swing of your step the life of the party, you're showing off again.
And I roll my eyes and then you pull me in.
I'm not much for dancing but for you I did.
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets.
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something there's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions.
And I'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes.
All that I know is I don't know how to be something you miss.
Never thought we'd have a last kiss never imagined we'd end like this.
Your name, forever the name on my lips so I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep.
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe and I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are.
Hope it's nice where you are and I hope the sun shines.
And it's a beautiful day and something reminds you.
You wish you had stayed you can plan for a change in weather and time.
But I never planned on you changing your mind so I'll go sit on the floor.
never thought we'd have a last kiss.
Just like our last kiss forever the name on my lips.
Forever the name on my lips just like our last...
I said remember this moment in the back of my mind the time we stood with our shaking hands.
The crowds in stands went wild we were the Kings and the Queens.
And they read off our names the night you danced like you knew our lives.
Would never be the same you held your head like a hero.
On a history book page It was the end of a decade.
But the start of an age long live the walls we crashed through.
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you I was screaming long live all the magic we made.
And bring on all the pretenders one day, we will be remembered.
I said remember this feeling I pass the pictures around.
Of all the years that we stood there on the side-lines wishing for right now.
We are the Kings and the Queens you traded your baseball cap for a crown.
When they gave us our trophies and we held them up for our town.
And the cynics were outraged screaming, "This is absurd!".
Cause for a moment a band of thieves In ripped up jeans got to rule the world.
Long live the walls we crashed through how the kingdom lights shined just for me and you.
I was screaming long live all the magic we made and bring on all the pretenders.
I'm not afraid long live all the mountains we moved.
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you I was screaming long live that look on your face.
Hold on to spinning around confetti falls to the ground.
May these memories break our fall will you take a moment, promise me this.
That you'll stand by me forever but if God forbid fate should step in.
And force us into a goodbye If you have children some day.
When they point to the pictures please tell them my name.
Tell them how the crowds went wild tell them how I hope they shine.
I had the time of my life, with you.
Long, long live the walls we crashed through And I was screaming long live all the magic we made singing, long live all the mountains we moved.
and long, long live the look on your face.
Elevator buttons and morning air strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs.
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares but right now my time is theirs.
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves they'll judge it like they know about me and you.
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do the jury's out, but my choice is you.
So don't you worry your pretty little mind people throw rocks at things that shine.
And life makes love look hard the stakes are high, the water's rough.
But this love is ours you never know what people have up their sleeves.
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles.
But I don't care 'cause right now you're mine and you'll say.
Don't you worry your pretty little mind and it's not theirs to speculate.
If it's wrong and your hands are tough.
But they are where mine belong and I'll fight their doubt and give you faith.
With this song for you 'Cause I love the gap between your teeth.
And I love the riddles that you speak and any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored.
'Cause my heart is yours so don't you worry your pretty little mind.
People throw rocks at things that shine and life makes love look hard.
But they can't take what's ours they can't take what's ours.
The stakes are high, the water's rough but this love is ours.
Last night I heard my own heart beating sounded like footsteps on my stairs.
Six months gone and I'm still reaching even though I know you're not there.
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby thinking 'bout everything we've been through.
Maybe I've been going back too much lately when time stood still and I had you.
Come back, come back, come back to me like you would, you would if this was a movie.
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out come back, come back, come back to me like.
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry I know that we could work it out somehow.
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now I know people change and these things happen.
But I remember how it was back then locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing.
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street.
Flashback to the night when you said to me "Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you.
Not before I knew how much I had to lose." You would, you would if this was a movie stand in the rain outside 'til I came out.
you could, you could if you just said you're sorry.
I know that we could work it out somehow but if this was a movie you'd be here by now.
If you're out there If you're somewhere.
If you're moving on I've been waiting for you.
Ever since you've been gone I just want it back the way it was before.
And I just wanna see you back at my front door. and I'd say.
you would before you said, "It's not that easy.".
Before the fight, before I locked you out but I take it all back now.
you'd be here by now.
It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now baby, what about the ending.
Oh, I thought you'd be here by now, whoa thought you'd be here by now.
Tall, dark and superman he puts papers in his briefcase and drives away.
To save the world or go to work It's the same thing to me.
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him.
I hang on every word you say, yay and you smile and say, "How are you? ".
I say, "Just fine" I always forget to tell you, I love you, I love you... forever.
I watch superman fly away you've got a busy day today.
Go save the world, I'll be around I watch superman fly away.
Come back I'll be with you someday I'll be right here on the ground.
When you come back down tall, dark and beautiful.
He's complicated, he's irrational but I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah.
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin' he's not all bad like his reputation.
And I can't hear one single word they say and you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be OK.
I always forget to tell you I love you, I loved you from the very first day You've got a busy day today go save the world I'll be around.
come back I'll be with you someday.
I'll be right here on the ground when you come back down.
And I watch you fly around the world and I hope you don't save some other girl.
Don't forget, don't forget about me I'm far away but I never let you go.
I'm lovestruck and looking out the window don't forget, don't forget where I'll be.
Right here wishing the flowers were from you wishing the card was from you.
Wishing the call was from you 'Cause I loved you from the very first day.
Go save the world, I'll be around... forever and ever here.
I swear I'll be with you someday.
La, la, la, la, la, la la, la, la, la, la, la.
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights.
Busy streets and busy lives and all we know.
Is touch and go we are alone with our changing minds.
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time and I never (never) saw you coming.
And I'll never (never) be the same you come around and the armor falls.
Pierce the room like a cannonball now all we know is don't let go.
We are alone, just you and me up in your room and our slates are clean.
Just twin fire signs four blue eyes.
So you were never a saint and I've loved in shades of wrong.
We learn to live with the pain mosaic broken hearts.
But this love is brave and wild and I never (never)  saw you coming.
this is a state of grace.
This is the worthwhile fight love is a ruthless game.
Unless you play it good and right these are the hands of fate.
You're my Achilles heel this is the golden age of something good and right and real.
And I never (never) saw you coming and I'll never (never) be the same.
And I never (never)  saw you coming This is a state of grace this is the worthwhile fight.
Love is a ruthless game unless you play it good and right.
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly.
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all.
Losing him was blue like I'd never known missing him was dark grey all alone.
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met but loving him was red.
Loving him was red touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you.
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer.
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong losing him was blue like I'd never known.
Missing him was dark grey all alone forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met.
But loving him was red oh, red.
Burning red remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes.
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go but moving on from him is impossible.
When I still see it all in my head In burning red.
Burning, it was red oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known.
'Cause loving him was red yeah, yeah, red.
We're burning red and that's why he's spinnin' 'round in my head.
Comes back to me, burning red yeah, yeah.
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street put your lips close to mine.
As long as they don't touch out of focus, eye to eye.
Till the gravity's too much and I'll do anything you say.
If you say it with your hands and I'd be smart to walk away.
But you're quicksand this slope is treacherous.
This path is reckless And I, I, I like it I can't decide if it's a choice.
Getting swept away I hear the sound of my own voice.
Asking you to stay and all we are is skin and bone.
Trained to get along forever going with the flow.
But you're friction two headlights shine through the sleepless night.
And I will get you, and get you alone your name has echoed through my mind.
And I just think you should, think you should know that nothing safe is worth the drive and I would.
Follow you, follow you home... I'll follow you, follow you home...
This hope is treacherous this daydream is dangerous.
I, I, I... I, I, I... I, I, I...
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night and I will get you, and get you alone.
Your name has echoed through my mind and I just think you should, think you should know.
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I will follow you, follow you home...
I'll follow you, follow you home... I, I, I like it I think--I think when it's all over.
It just comes back in flashes, you know? It's like a kaleidoscope of memories.
It just all comes back. But he never does. I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen.
It's not really anything he said or anything he did It was the feeling that came along with it.
And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again. but I don't know if I should.
I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright. but I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you?
Maybe he knew that when he saw me. I guess I just lost my balance.
I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him. It was losing me.
Once upon a time a few mistakes ago I was in your sights, you got me alone.
You found me, you found me, you found me I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that.
And when I fell hard you took a step back without me, without me, without me.
And he's long gone when he's next to me and I realize the blame is on me.
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in so shame on me now.
Flew me to places I'd never been 'Til you put me down, oh.
I knew you were trouble when you walked in now I'm lying on the cold hard ground.
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble.
No apologies. He'll never see you cry pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why.
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning. now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street.
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be and now I see, now I see, now I see.
He was long gone when he met me and I realize the joke is on me, yeah!
And the saddest fear comes creeping in that you never loved me or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah.
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (you were right there, you were right there) trouble, trouble, trouble.
I don't know if you know who you are until you lose who you are. I walked through the door with you, the air was cold.
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow. and I left my scarf there at your sister's house.
And you've still got it in your drawer even now. oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze.
We're singing in the car, getting lost Upstate. autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place.
And I can picture it after all these days. and I know it's long gone.
And that magic's not here no more and I might be okay.
But I'm not fine at all. 'Cause there we are again on that little town street.
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me. wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well.
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red. you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed.
And your mother's telling stories about you on a tee ball team you taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me.
And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do.
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to...
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night. we're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light.
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah. well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much.
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up. running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well.
Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise. so casually cruel in the name of being honest.
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here 'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well.
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it.
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own now you mail back my things and I walk home alone.
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week 'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me.
You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah 'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so.
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well.
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all.
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters.
And make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh. It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight.
To fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uh. we're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time.
It's miserable and magical. oh, yeah.
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines It's time.
Uh oh! I don't know about you.
But I'm feeling 22 everything will be alright.
If you keep me next to you you don't know about me.
But I'll bet you want to If we just keep dancing like we're 22, ooh-ooh.
22, ooh-ooh It seems like one of those nights.
This place is too crowded. too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh (who's Taylor Swift anyway, ew?).
It seems like one of those nights we ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming.
Instead of sleeping. we're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way.
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks Uh oh! (hey!) everything will be alright (alright).
22, ooh-ooh (oh, oh, oh).
It feels like one of those nights we ditch the whole scene.
we won't be sleeping.
you look like bad news.
I gotta have you I gotta have you.
Ooh-ooh, ye-e-e-e-eah, hey I don't know about you (I don't know about you).
you don't know about me (you don't know about me).
22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah.
22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah It feels like one of those nights.
We ditch the whole scene We won't be sleeping You look like bad news I gotta have you. I bet this time of night you're still up.
I bet you're tired from a long hard week. I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city.
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me. and I just wanna tell you.
It takes everything in me not to call you. and I wish I could run to you.
And I hope you know that every time I don't I almost do.
I almost do. I bet you think I either moved on or hate you.
'Cause each time you reach out there's no reply. I bet it never ever occurred to you that I can't say "Hello" to you.
And risk another goodbye. oh, we made quite a mess, babe.
It's probably better off this way. and I confess, babe.
In my dreams you're touching my face and asking me if I wanna try again with you.
And I almost do. And I hope sometimes you wonder about me. I remember when we broke up the first time.
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like we hadn't seen each other in a month.
When you said you needed space. (What?) then you come around again and say.
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me." remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you." ooh, we called it off again last night.
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you we are never ever ever getting back together.
We are never ever ever getting back together you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me.
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together like, ever...
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights and me falling for it screaming that I'm right.
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind with some indie record that's much cooler than mine.
Ooh, you called me up again tonight but ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you.
We are never, ever, ever getting back together we are never, ever, ever getting back together.
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me) but we are never ever ever ever getting back together.
Ooh, yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah oh oh oh.
I used to think that we were forever ever and I used to say, "Never say never...".
Uggg... so he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you," and I'm like... "I just... I mean this is exhausting, you know, like.
We are never getting back together. Like, ever" we, ooh, getting back together, ohhh.
We, ooh, getting back together you go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me).
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night.
I threw my phone across the room at you. I was expecting some dramatic turn-away.
But you stayed. this morning I said we should talk about it.
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved. that's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said, "Okay, let's talk.".
And I said stay, stay, stay.
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time. you think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
But I think that it's best if we both stay. before you I'd only dated self-indulgent takers.
Who took all of their problems out on me. but you carry my groceries, and now I'm always laughin'.
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to... But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay. you took the time to memorize me:.
My fears, my hopes, and dreams. I just like hangin' out with you all the time.
All those times that you didn't leave; It's been occurring to me I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life.
And I'll be loving you for quite some time. no one else is gonna love me, when I get mad, mad, mad.
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay. But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay. that's so fun!
I find myself at your door just like all those times before.
I'm not sure how I got there all roads-they lead me here.
I imagine you are home In your room, all alone.
And you open your eyes into mine and everything feels better.
and right before your eyes I'm breaking, no past.
No reasons why just you and me.
This is the last time I'm asking you this put my name at the top of your list.
This is the last time I'm asking you why you break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye.
You find yourself at my door You wear your best apology but I was there to watch you leave.
And all the times I let you in just for you to go again.
Disappear when you come back everything is better.
I'm aching, no past.
Nowhere to hide just you and me...
you break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye...
This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong this is the last time I say it's been you all along.
This is the last time I let you in my door this is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore.
this is the last time I'm asking you this.
Put my name at the top of your list this is the last time I'm asking you why.
You break my heart in the blink of an eye. this is the last time I'm asking you.
Last time I'm asking you last time I'm asking you this...
I was reminiscing just the other day while having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away.
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York Time. back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme.
Took off faster than a green light "Go". yeah, you skipped the conversation when you already know.
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made and that was the first day.
And darling, it was good never looking down. and right there where we stood was holy ground.
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress we had this big wide city all to ourselves.
We blocked the noise with the sound of 'I need you' and for the first time I had something to lose.
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way. and the story's got dust on every page.
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now. and I see your face in every crowd.
Cause darling, it was good never looking down. Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through. but I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you.
Tonight I'm gonna dance like you were in this room. It was good never looking down. Long handwritten note deep in your pocket words, how little they mean when you're a little too late.
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait.
We had a beautiful magic love there what a sad beautiful tragic love affair.
In dreams I meet you in warm conversation we both wake in lonely beds in different cities.
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you and you've got your demons, and, darling, they all look like me.
'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting silence, this train runs off its tracks.
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen? hang up, give up, for the life of us we can't get back.
A beautiful magic love there what a sad beautiful tragic, beautiful tragic, beautiful.
What we had - a beautiful magic love there New to town with a made up name in the angel's city chasing fortune and fame.
And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream. you had it figured out since you were in school.
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool. so overnight you look like a sixties' queen.
Another name goes up in lights, like diamonds in the sky. and they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one.
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one. but can you tell me now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh...
Now it's big black cars, and Riviera views and your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you.
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page. and they tell you that you're lucky.
But you're so confused 'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used.
And all the young things line up to take your place. another name goes up in lights. You wonder if you'll make it out alive.
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one. yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one.
Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh. It was a few years later, I showed up here.
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared how you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out.
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square.
And it took some time, but I understand it now. 'Cause now my name is up in lights, but I think you got it right.
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one. let me tell you now, you're the lucky one.
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh. yeah they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one.
and they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, whoa, oh, oh all I knew this morning when I woke.
Is I know something now, know something now I didn't before. and all I've seen since eighteen hours ago.
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile In the back of my mind making me feel like.
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now.
I just wanna know you, know you, know you.
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello." and your eyes look like coming home.
All I know is a simple name everything has changed.
All I know is you held the door you'll be mine and I'll be yours.
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed and all my walls stood tall painted blue.
And I'll take them down, take them down and open up the door for you and all I feel in my stomach is butterflies.
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time taking flight, making me feel right.
Taking flight, making me feel right like I just wanna know you, know you, know you 'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello.".
And your eyes look like coming home all I know is a simple name.
Everything has changed all I know is you held the door.
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours all I know since yesterday is everything has changed.
Come back and tell me why I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time, oh, oh, oh.
And meet me there tonight and let me know that it's not all in my mind.
All I know is we said, "Hello." all I know is we said, "Hello.".
So dust off your highest hopes all I know is pouring rain and everything has changed.
All I know is a new found grace all my days I'll know your face.
I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune".
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved. the whole place was dressed to the nines.
And we were dancing, dancing like we're made of starlight.
Like we're made of starlight I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45.
Picked me up late one night out the window we were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild.
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in the night we snuck into a yacht club party.
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince and I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune.".
like we're made of starlight, starlight.
Like we're made of starlight, starlight he said, "Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change.
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way." he was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me.
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight? don't you dream impossible things?".
Like "Oh my, what a marvelous tune." It was the best night, never would forget how he moved.
The whole place was dressed to the nines and we were dancing, dancing.
Ooh ooh he's talking crazy ooh ooh dancing with me.
Ooh ooh we could get married have ten kids and teach them how to dream.
Oh my, what a marvelous tune like we dream impossible dreams.
Like starlight, starlight Don't you see the starlight, starlight? don't you dream impossible things?
Took a deep breath in the mirror he didn't like it when I wore high heels.
But I do turn the lock and put my headphones on.
He always said he didn't get this song but I do, I do.
Walked in expecting you'd be late but you got here early and you stand and wave.
I walk to you you pull my chair out and help me in.
And you don't know how nice that is but I do.
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did.
I've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end.
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again you said you never met one girl.
Who had as many James Taylor records as you We tell stories and you don't know why I'm coming off a little shy.
but you throw your head back laughing like a little kid.
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did I've been spending the last eight months.
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end but on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again.
And we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up but you start to talk about the movies that your family.
Every single Christmas and I want to talk about that and for the first time what's past is past.
'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid You should've been there should've burst through the door.
With that 'baby I'm right here' smile and it would've felt like.
A million little shining stars had just aligned and I would've been so happy.
Christmas lights glisten I've got my eye on the door.
Just waiting for you to walk in but the time is ticking.
People ask me how I've been as I comb back through my memory.
How you said you'd be here you said you'd be here.
And it was like slow motion standing there in my party dress.
In red lipstick with no one to impress.
And they're all laughing as I'm looking around the room.
But there's one thing missing and that was the moment I knew.
And the hours pass by now I just wanna be alone.
But your close friends always seem to know when there's something really wrong.
So they follow me down the hall and there in the bathroom.
I try not to fall apart and the sinking feeling starts.
As I say hopelessly "He said he'd be here.".
and asking me about you.
But there was one thing missing What do you say when tears are streaming down your face.
In front of everyone you know? and what do you do when the one.
Who means the most to you Is the one who didn't show?
You should've been here. And they're all standing around me singing "Happy birthday to you".
Ooh, I knew. you called me later.
And said, "I'm sorry, I didn't make it," and I said, "I'm sorry too,".
And that was the moment I knew. you said it in a simple way.
4 AM, the second day how strange that I don't know you at all.
Stumbled through the long goodbye one last kiss, then catch your flight.
Right when I was just about to fall I told myself, "Don't get attached,".
But in my mind I play it back spinning faster than the plane that took you...
And this is when the feeling sinks in I don't wanna miss you like this.
Come back... be here, come back... be here. I guess you're in New York today.
I don't wanna need you this way come back... be here, come back... be here.
The delicate beginning rush the feeling you can know so much.
Without knowing anything at all. and now that I can't put this down.
If I had known what I'd known now I never would have played so nonchalant.
Taxi cabs and busy streets that never bring you back to me.
I can't help but wish you took me with you... and this is when the feeling sinks in.
I don't wanna miss you like this I guess you're in London today I don't wanna need you this way.
this is falling in love in the cruelest way.
This is falling for you when you are worlds away. new York... be here.
But you're in London and I break down 'Cause it's not fair that you're not around.
This is when the feeling sinks in And I don't wanna need you this way I don't wanna miss you like this. come back... be here.
Come back... be here. don't look at me.
You've got a girl at home and everybody knows that.
Everybody knows that uh, uh.
Don't look at me you've got a girl at home.
And everybody knows that. I don't even know her.
But I feel a responsibility to do what's upstanding and right.
It's kinda like a code, yeah and you've been getting closer and closer.
And crossing so many lines. and it would be a fine proposition.
If I was a stupid girl but honey I am no-one's exception.
This I have previously learned. so don't look at me.
And everybody knows that everybody knows that.
I see you turn off your phone and now you got me alone.
And I say Everybody knows that. I just wanna make sure.
You understand perfectly you're the kind of man who makes me sad.
While she waits up you chase down the newest thing.
And take for granted what you have. and yeah I might go with it.
If I hadn't once been just like her. and now you've got me alone.
call a cab.
Lose my number you're about to lose your girl.
Call a cab lose my number.
Let's consider this lesson learned. Wanna see you pick up your phone and tell her you're coming home.
Uh, uh It would be a fine proposition.
walking through a crowd.
The village is aglow kaleidoscope of loud.
Heartbeats under coats everybody here.
Wanted something more searching for a sound we hadn't.
Heard before and it said.
Welcome to New York It's been waiting for you.
welcome to New York.
It's a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat, beat.
Forever more the lights are so bright.
But they never blind me, me It's been waiting for you When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors.
Took our broken hearts put them in a drawer.
Everybody here was someone else and you can want who you want.
Boys and boys and girls and girls.

The lights are so bright but they never blind me.

They never blind me nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things magic, madness, heaven, sin.
Saw you there and I thought oh my God, look at that face.

Ain't it funny, rumors fly and I know you heard about me.
So hey, let's be friends I'm dying to see how this one ends.
Grab your passport and my hand I can make the bad guys good for a weekend.
So it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames.
You can tell me when it's over If the high was worth the pain.
Got a long list of ex-lovers they'll tell you I'm insane.
'Cause you know I love the players and you love the game.
'Cause we're young and we're reckless we'll take this way too far.
It'll leave you breathless or with a nasty scar.
But I've got a blank space, baby and I'll write your name.
Cherry lips, crystal skies I could show you incredible things.
Stolen kisses, pretty lies you're the King, baby, I'm your Queen.
Find out what you want be that girl for a month.
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no screaming, crying, perfect storms.
I can make all the tables turn rose garden filled with thorns.
Keep you second guessing like "Oh my God, who is she?".
I get drunk on jealousy but you'll come back each time you leave.
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream so it's gonna be forever.
Or it's gonna go down in flames you can tell me when it's over.
If the high was worth the pain got a long list of ex-lovers.
They'll tell you I'm insane 'Cause you know I love the players.
And you love the game 'Cause we're young and we're reckless.
We'll take this way too far It'll leave you breathless.
Or with a nasty scar but I've got a blank space, baby.
And I'll write your name boys only want love if it's torture.
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya you come and pick me up, no headlights.
A long drive could end in burning flames or paradise.
Fade into view, oh, it's been a while since I have even heard from you (heard from you) I should just tell you to leave 'cause I.
Know exactly where it leads but I watch us go 'round and 'round each time.
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye and I got that red lip classic thing that you like.
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time 'Cause we never go out of style.
We never go out of style you got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt.
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt and when we go crashing down, we come back every time.
'Cause we never go out of style we never go out of style.
So it goes he can't keep his wild eyes on the road.
Takes me home lights are off, he's taking off his coat, hmm, yeah.
I say, "I heard, oh, that you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl." he says, "What you've heard is true but I.
Can't stop thinking about you," and I... I said, "I've been there, too, a few times.".
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (tight little skirt) Take me home just take me home, yeah.
Just take me home (out of style).
looking at it now.
It all seems so simple we were lying on your couch.
I remember you took a Polaroid of us.
Then discovered (then discovered) the rest of the world was black and white.
But we were in screaming color and I remember thinking...
Are we out of the woods yet? are we out of the woods yet?
are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet?
Are we out of the woods? Last December (last December) we were built to fall apart.
Then fall back together (back together) your necklace hanging from my neck.
The night we couldn't quite forget when we decided (we decided).
To move the furniture so we could dance baby, like we stood a chance.
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying and I remember thinkin'.
(Are we out of the woods?!) remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in the hospital room when you started cryin', baby, I did, too.
But when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you remember when we couldn't take the heat.
I walked out and said, "I'm settin' you free," but the monsters turned out to be just trees.
And when the sun came up, you were lookin' at me you were lookin' at me.
You were lookin' at me I remember, oh, I remember.
People like you always want back the love they gave away and people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed.
The more I think about it now the less I know all I know is that you drove us off the road.
Hey, all you had to do was stay had me in the palm of your hand.
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in stay, hey, now you say you want it.
Back now that it's just too late well, it could've been easy.
All you had to do was stay all you had to do was stay.
here you are now, calling me up, but I don't know what to say.
I've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made people like you always want back the love they pushed aside.
But people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye hey, all you had to do was stay.
Had me in the palm of your hand then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in.
Stay, hey, now you say you want it back now that it's just too late.
Well, it could've been easy let me remind.
You this was what you wanted you ended it.
You were all I wanted but not like this.
Not like this not like this.
Oh, all you had to do was stay I stay out too late.
Got nothing in my brain that's what people say, mmm-mmm.
That's what people say, mmm-mmm I go on too many dates.
But I can't make them stay at least that's what people say, mmm-mmm.
but I keep cruising.
Can't stop, won't stop moving It's like I got this music.
In my mind saying, "It's gonna be alright.".
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play and the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake I shake it off, I shake it off.
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break and the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.
I never miss a beat I'm lightning on my feet.
And that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm.
I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own) I make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go).
And that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm.
But I keep cruising can't stop, won't stop grooving.

Saying, "It's gonna be alright." 'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play.
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake.

Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world you could've been getting down to this sick beat.

Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start you say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead.
You're thinking that I hate you now 'Cause you still don't know what I never said.
I wish you would come back wish I never hung up the phone like I did.
And I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live. and I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good.
I wish you would It's 2 AM in my room.
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you. we're a crooked love in a straight line down.
Makes you wanna run and hide then it makes you turn right back around.
I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live. I wish we could go back.
And remember what we were fighting for. and I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore.
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good. I wish you would.
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish.
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish. you always knew how to push my buttons.
You give me everything and nothing this mad mad love makes you come running.
To stand back where you stood I wish you would, I wish you would.
I wish you would, I wish you would I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish...
2 AM, here we are see your face, hear my voice in the dark.
We're a crooked love in a straight line down makes you wanna run and hide.
But it made us turn right back around I wish you would come back.
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did I wish you knew that I'll never forget you as long as I live.
You always knew how to push my buttons you give me everything and nothing.
This mad mad love makes you come running to stand back where you stood.
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish you would 'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood.
You know it used to be mad love so take a look what you've done.
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood now we got problems.
And I don't think we can solve them you made a really deep cut.
And, baby, now we got bad blood did you have to do this? I was thinking that you could be trusted.
Did you have to ruin what was shiny? Now it's all rusted did you have to hit me, where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe.
And rub it in so deep, salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I.
you know it used to be mad love.
So take a look what you've done Now we got problems and I don't think we can solve them.
You made a really deep cut and, baby, now we got bad blood.
Did you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my back from your knife so don't think it's in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
Now did you think it all through? All these things will catch up to you and time can heal but this won't, so if you're coming my way, just don't.
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I band-aids don't fix bullet holes.
You say sorry just for show If you live like that, you live with ghosts (ghosts).
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (hey) you say sorry just for show (hey).
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (hey) If you love like that blood runs cold.
you know it used to be mad love (mad love).
and I don't think we can solve them (think we can solve them).
So take a look what you've done (look what you've done) He said, "Let's get out of this town. drive out of the city, away from the crowds.".
I thought heaven can't help me now. nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down.
He's so tall and handsome as hell he's so bad but he does it so well.
I can see the end as it begins my one condition is.
Say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress.
Staring at the sunset, babe red lips and rosy cheeks.
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your.
Wildest dreams, ah-ha oh wildest dreams, ah-ha oh.
I said, "No one has to know what we do." his hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room.
And his voice is a familiar sound nothing lasts forever but this is getting good now.
And when we've had our very last kiss my last request is.
You see me in hindsight tangled up with you all night.
Burning it down someday when you leave me.
I bet these memories follow you around.
You'll see me in hindsight even if it's just pretend.
even if it's just in your (just pretend, just pretend).
In your wildest dreams, ah-ha oh.
(even if it's just in your wildest dreams) ah-ha In your wildest dreams, ah-ha.
Oh oh oh. stand there like a ghost shaking from the rain (rain).
She'll open up the door and say, "Are you insane ('ane)?" say it's been a long 6 months.
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want. and that's how it works.
That's how you get the girl. and then you say.
"I want you for worse or for better I would wait forever and ever.
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together. I would wait forever and ever.".
And that's how it works It's how you get the girl, girl...
Remind her how it used to be (yeah, yeah) with pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks (cheeks).
Tell her how you must have lost your mind. (uh-uh) when you left her all alone, and never told her why (why).
And that's how it works. that's how you lost the girl.
And now you say "I want you for worse or for better.
I would wait forever and ever (ever and ever) broke your heart, I'll put it back together (together).
I would wait forever and ever (ever and ever)." It's how you get the girl, girl... It's how you get the girl, girl... (Yeah, yeah) and you could know (oh-oh oh oh).
That I don't want you to go oh-oh.. remind me how it used to be.
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks. and say you want me.
And then you say "I want you for worse or for better (for worse or for better).
I would wait forever and ever broke your heart, I'll put it back together.
I want you forever and ever." It's how you get the girl, girl. that's how it works.
That's how you got the girl. clear blue water, high tide came and brought you in.
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will skies grew darker, currents swept you out again.
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone In silent screams.
In wildest dreams I never dreamed of this.
This love is good, this love is bad this love is alive back from the dead.
These hands had to let it go free and this love came back to me.
Tossing, turning, struggled through the night with someone new and I could go on and on, on and on.
Lantern burning, flickered in my mind for only you but you're still gone, gone, gone.
Been losing grip on sinking ships.
You showed up just in time this love is good, this love is bad.
This love is alive back from the dead these hands had to let it go free.
And this love came back to me this love left a permanent mark.
This love is glowing in the dark this love, this love, this love, this love...
Your kiss, my cheek, I watched you leave your smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees.
When you're young you just run but you come back to what you need.
This love left a permanent mark this love is glowing in the dark.
This love, this love, this love, this love... you stand with your hand on my waist line.
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight I can hear them whisper as we pass by.
It's a bad sign, bad sign something happens when everybody finds out.
See the vultures circling dark clouds love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out.
It could burn out cause they got the cages, they got the boxes.
And guns they are the hunters, we are the foxes.
And we run baby, I know places we won't be found.
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down cause I, I know places we can hide.
I know places, I know places lights flash and we'll run for the fences.
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it loose lips sink ships all the damn time.
Not this time just grab my hand and don't ever drop it.
My love I know places they take their shots, but we're bulletproof.
and you know for me, it's always you.
In the dead of night, your eyes so green.
and I know for you, it's always me.
the drought was the very worst.
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst It was months, and months of back and forth.
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore hung my head as I lost the war, and the sky turned black like a perfect storm.
Rain came pouring down when I was drowning that's when I could finally breathe.
And by morning gone was any trace of you I think I am finally clean.
There was nothing left to do when the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room.
So I punched a hole in the roof let the flood carry away all my pictures of you.
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing rain came pouring down when I was drowning.
That's when I could finally breathe and by morning, gone was any trace of you.
I think I am finally clean Said I think I am finally clean 10 months sober, I must admit.
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it 10 months older, I won't give in.
Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it and by morning gone was any trace of you.
finally clean.
Think I'm finally clean think I'm finally clean.
Flashing lights and we took a wrong turn and we.
Fell down a rabbit hole. you held on tight to me.
'Cause nothing's as it seems I'm spinning out of control.
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things? didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds? didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me I should have slept with one eye open at night.
We found wonderland you and I got lost in it.
And we pretended it could last forever we found wonderland.
You and I got lost in it and life was never worse but never better.
Eh eh In wonderland.
In wonderland so we went on our way.
Too in love to think straight all alone or so it seemed.
But there were strangers watching and whispers turned to talking.
And talking turned to screams. didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me? didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?
Didn't it all seem new and exciting? I felt your arms twisting around me.
It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind. but darling, we found wonderland.
and we pretended it could last forever.
And life was never worse but never better eh eh.
I reached for you but you were gone I knew I had to go back home.
You search the world for something else to make you feel like what we had and in the end in wonderland we both went mad.
And we pretended it could last forever (last forever) you and I got lost in it (got lost in it).
And life was never worse but never better (never better) you and I got lost in it (wonderland).
And we pretended it could last forever (in wonderland) You and I got lost in it (wonderland) one look, dark room.
Meant just for you time moved too fast.
You play it back buttons on a coat.
Lighthearted joke no proof, not much.
But you saw enough small talk, he drives.
Coffee at midnight the light reflects.
The chain on your neck he says, "Look up.".
And your shoulders brush no proof, one touch.
But you felt enough you can hear it in the silence, silence.
You can feel it on the way home, way home you could see it with the lights out, lights out.
You are in love, true love you are in love.
Morning, his place burnt toast, Sunday.
You keep his shirt he keeps his word.
And for once you let go of your fears and your ghosts.
One step, not much but it said enough.
You kiss on sidewalks you fight then you talk.
One night he wakes strange look on his face.
Pauses, then says. "You're my best friend.".
And you knew what it was he is in love.
You can hear it in the silence, silence you can feel it on the way home, way home.
You could see it with the lights out, lights out you are in love, true love.
And so it goes you two are dancing in a snow globe 'round and 'round.
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown and you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars.
And why I spent my whole life trying to put it into words 'Cause you can hear it in the silence.
You can feel it on the way home you could see it with the lights out.
you're in love.
You're in love you can see it with the lights out, lights out.
We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything we wait for trains that just aren't coming.
We show off our different scarlet letters- trust me, mine is better.
We're so young but we're on the road to ruin we play dumb but we know exactly what we're doing.
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom honey, life is just a classroom.
'Cause, baby, I could build a castle out of all the bricks they threw at me.
And every day is like a battle but every night with us is like a dream.
Baby, we're the new romantics come on, come along with me.
Heart break is the national anthem we sing it proudly.
We are too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet.
the best people in life are free.
We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding we hang back, it's all in the timing.
It's poker, he can't see it in my face but I'm about to play my Ace.
We need love, but all we want is danger we team up then switch sides like a record changer.
The rumors are terrible and cruel but, honey, most of them are true.
So come on, come along with me Please take my hand and please take me dancing and.
Please leave me stranded It's so romantic.
